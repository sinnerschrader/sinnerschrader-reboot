Facebook uses cookies to store and further process this information, and these cookies are stored on the various devices of the visitors to the Facebook fan page, especially when the visitors are registered members of Facebook. As a result, Facebook can display targeted advertising on its own platform and also on third-party pages. Facebook does not publish in full and we do not know to what extent Facebook uses the above-mentioned data for its own purposes, to what extent activities on the Facebook fan page are associated with individual users, how long Facebook stores this data and whether data is disclosed to third parties.</p><p>Facebook, Inc., the US parent company of Facebook Ireland Ltd., is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield and has thus declared that it complies with the European level of data protection and the accompanying data policies. As the operator of the Facebook fan page, we cannot rule out the possibility that data belonging to users of the Facebook fan page will be transferred to and processed in third countries, nor can we exclude any related risks.</p><p>For further information, please also see Facebook’s data policy: <a class="copy--mail" href="https://facebook.com/about/privacy/">https://facebook.com/about/privacy/</a></p><p>Facebook furthermore offers the option of objecting to specific forms of data processing; you will find related information and opt-out choices at <a class="copy--mail" href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads">https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads</a>.</p><p>We use the statistics services Facebook Insights for the purpose of designing and continually updating our pages as needed. This service records your activity on our page and sends it to us in the form of anonymised statistics. This allows us to gain an insight among other things into the activity of the visitors to our fan page, page views, the reach of contributions, views and average duration of video playbacks, information about which countries and cities our visitors come from as well as statistics on the gender balance of our visitors.</p><p>In addition, Facebook records data if you interact with our page as a registered Facebook user (e.g. if you click a Like button, send us a message, or post a comment). These interactions are also recorded and provided in the statistics by Facebook; we as the operator are unable to exert an influence on this. It is therefore not possible for us as the fan page operator to deactivate this function or to prevent data from being generated and processed.</p><p>It is not possible for us as the fan page operator to identify individual users or to access individual user profiles on the basis of the insights automatically provided by Facebook.</p><p>You can find more detailed information on Facebook Insights from Facebook here (<a class="copy--mail" href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/information_about_page_insights_data"> https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/information_about_page_insights_data</a>).</p><p>Facebook and we share responsibility for processing the Insights data. The details of this are governed by the agreement on shared responsibility (Joint Controller Addendum), which you can find here ( <a class="copy--mail" href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum">https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum</a>).</p><p>As the fan page operator, we also process data to a very limited extent only. Our fan page is operated on the legal basis of a balance of interests in accordance with Art 6(1) f) GDPR.</p><p>In addition, we store user names and comments that are deleted on account of a breach of netiquette. These are tracked only in order to furnish any evidence that may be required in legal disputes within the period of limitation.</p><p>The legal basis for us as the operator of the Facebook fan page to process data as mentioned above is Art. 6(1) b) GDPR (e.g. if you send us a request relating to a contract) on the one hand. On the other, the data can also be processed on the basis of your consent pursuant to Art. 6(1) a) GDPR (e.g. if you “like” or comment on one of our posts or upload content onto our page). You can withdraw the consent you have given at any time with effect for the future by deleting the comment or the content in question. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent given before it is withdrawn.</p><p>Facebook has assumed the primary responsibility for the processing of personal data using the “Insights” service offered by Facebook. This concerns the processing of Insights data and the implementation of the rights of the data subject. Please therefore contact Facebook directly concerning all obligations arising from the GDPR in relation to the processing of Insights data. We will forward to Facebook any queries that we receive from you on this subject.</p></section></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="accenture-brand"><div class="grid"><div class="accenture-brand__item col-start-11 col-end-13 col-start-9-s col-end-11-s col-start-5-xs col-end-12-xs"><img alt="text: part of Accenture Interactive" class="accenture-brand__logo" src="/assets/svg/accenture-logo.svg"></div></div></div><div class="grid footer__wrapper"><a class="footer__s2-link col-start-1 col-end-6" href="/"><img alt="SinnerSchrader logo" src="/assets/svg/sinnerschrader-logo.svg"> </a><span class="footer__s2-conference-links col-start-1 col-end-12">Creator of <a class="footer__link underline-white" href="https://nextconf.eu/" rel="external nofollow">NEXT Conference</a><br>and enabler of <a class="footer__link" href="https://jsconf.eu/" rel="external nofollow">JSConf EU</a></span><div class="footer__s2-links col-start-9 col-end-11 col-start-7-m col-end-10-m col-start-6-s col-end-9-s col-start-1-xs col-end-7-xs"><ul class="footer__list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link" href="mailto:info@sinnerschrader.com" rel="">Contact</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link" href="/data-policy" rel="">Data Policy</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link" href="/imprint" rel="">Imprint</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link" href="https://github.com/sinnerschrader/sinnerschrader-reboot" rel="">Improve this site</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer__s2-links col-start-11 col-end-13 col-start-10-m col-end-13-m col-start-10-s col-end-13-s col-start-7-xs col-end-13-xs"><ul class="footer__list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link" href="https://twitter.com/sinnerschrader" rel="">Twitter</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link" href="https://www.facebook.com/SinnerSchrader" rel="">Facebook</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sinnerschrader/" rel="">LinkedIn</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link" href="https://medium.com/still-day-one" rel="">Medium</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link" href="https://dev.to/s2engineers" rel="">DEV Community</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link" href="https://github.com/sinnerschrader" rel="">GitHub</a></li></ul></div></div></footer></body></html>
