  - "There are two challenging opportunities at the moment: The first one is for
    enterprise content-driven project with high complexity for a German car
    manufacturer. You will have great chance to work full stack - from styles to
    containers and everything in between. It is also great chance to build
    microservices and microfrontends. Cool, isn't it? And our multinational
    Scrum team is willing to teach, mentor, and grow together with you - you
    will not be alone at all."
  - The other is project for another large German car manufacturer that
    understand the reasons of an agile work. You will use your frontend skills
    to the fullest - it's complex project with a lot of space for learning new
    things (e.g. recently we started focusing on accessibility!). We have
    cross-located team, usually 5-8 people who are all looking forward to times
    when we can travel again between our offices (Prague and Hamburg) because it
    was always such a great team-building opportunity.
requirements:
  - Experience with React in bigger projects, cool would be TypeScript, Node.js,
    Java, CI/CD, unit testing, responsive design, code review, Cypress tests,
    CSS
  - Familiarity with agile mindset & methods (Scrum, Kanban)
  - Strong conceptual and analytical skills as well as a structured, proactive
    approach to work
  - Team spirit in order to achieve goals together
  - Open mindset to new things and technologies
  - A high level of initiative and good communication skills
  - Very good communication in English (German is an advantage :) Jawohl!)
offers:
  - Exciting and innovative projects for well-known companies
  - Varied tasks and space for personal responsibility
