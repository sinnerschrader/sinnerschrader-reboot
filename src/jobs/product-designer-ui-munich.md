description: As a hands-on designer, you are sometimes an idea generator,
  sometimes an aggregator in the intensive collaboration between Product Design,
  Product Strategy, Product Engineering and Product and Client Management. What
  is unfamiliar to you arouses your curiosity; you approach the familiar with
  self-critical distance. You quickly find convincing solutions and are the
  leading creative force in winning new customers and deliver real added value
  for our existing customers with your work.
