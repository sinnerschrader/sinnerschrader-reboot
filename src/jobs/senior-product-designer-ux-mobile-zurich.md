description: >-
  SinnerSchrader Swipe is a studio with a focus on mobile product management,
  design and software engineering based in Hamburg, Berlin and Zurich. We
  develop digital products - radically user-centric services with a focus on
  digital (mobile) touchpoints. Our core competencies are experience design,
  product design, strategy and mobile engineering for iOS and Android. Our
  portfolio includes companies from the mobility, automotive, lifestyle and
  public service & health sectors. Well-known clients include Audi, Europa Park,
  Motel One, VW and ADAC. We also support the fight against the pandemic with
  our digital solutions.


  We are currently looking for a Senior Product Designer UX (f/m/x/-) for our Zurich office. 


  As a hands-on Senior UX Designer, you are sometimes an idea generator, sometimes an aggregator in the intensive collaboration between Research, Product Design, Product Strategy, Product Engineering and Product and Client Management. What is unfamiliar to you arouses your curiosity, what is familiar you approach with self-critical distance. Your excellent intuition and empathy for customer needs and product design drive you to search for the best solution. Sensitive visuality, high quality and user-centred thinking are equally important to you. You quickly find convincing solutions and are the leading creative force in the acquisition of new customers and deliver real added value for our existing customers with your work.

  - Definition of the vision, strategy and UX concept for client projects
  - Development of wireframes, sitemaps, process designs, flows and interactive
    prototypes

    guidance, interaction behaviour and information architecture)
  - Preparation and implementation of customer workshops
  - Preparation, implementation and evaluation of usability tests
  - Mentorship of colleagues at junior level

  - Completed studies with a focus on interaction design, information design,
    communication design or comparable qualification
  - In-depth professional experience in the field of user experience,
    information architecture and usability as well as in the conception of
    mobile applications
  - Methodological competence and experience in user-centred working methods
    such as design thinking
  - Outstanding analytical skills and a high level of abstraction
  - High quality standards and accurate working methods in industry-standard
    tools such as Figma, Sketch, InVision, prototyping tools, workshop tools
    such as Mural etc.
  - Ability to work on your own initiative and to make and defend conceptual
    decisions
  - Optimally experience with documentation and ticket tools such as Confluence
    and Jira
  - Business fluent in German and English
offers:
  - Exciting and innovative projects for well-known companies
  - Varied tasks and space for personal responsibility
  - Professional and personal development
  - A pleasant working atmosphere and short decision-making processes
