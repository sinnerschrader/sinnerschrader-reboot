  We are currently looking for a Senior Strategist (f/m/x/-) for our Frankfurt office.


  We’re looking for strategists who want to unlock potential for experiences that matter.  Strategists who design and revolutionize the digital platforms of tomorrow on the basis of sound methods, professional know-how and creative intuition. You are the kind of person who looks radically through the eyes of the user and develops beneficial and innovative solutions that make everyday life simpler and – above all – better. You are therefore equally at ease with service and experience design as you are with the standard strategy repertoire. You have a keen sense of brands and their business challenges in the digital age. You also have excellent communication and methodical skills in addition to an analytical and inspiring mind.

  - With our diverse backgrounds, we manage to understand our clients, our
    clients' clients, colleagues and bots, connect them and translate the
    different requirements and "languages"
  - As diverse and varied as our backgrounds and skills are, so is the role you
    take on as a strategist. You shape your own role and place
requirements:
  - Passion for digital topics - from use cases, vision setting to
    organisational structures
  - 4-6 years of strategy or service design experience in an agency or in the
    area of strategic client consulting in a consultancy firm
  - Enjoy working in multi-disciplinary agency and client teams with a deep

    analysis to experience design and digital business strategy
  - Confidence in creating compelling presentations and workshop set-ups - and
    successfully representing them to clients
  - Very good German and/or English skills
offers:
  - Exciting and innovative projects for well-known companies
  - Varied tasks and space for personal responsibility
  - Professional and personal development
  - A pleasant working atmosphere and short decision-making processes
