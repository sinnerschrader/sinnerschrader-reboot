  We are currently looking for a Strategist (f/m/x/-) for our Hamburg office.


  We are looking for strategists who want to transform the digital transformation. Strategists who shape and revolutionise the digital platforms of tomorrow on the basis of sound methods, professional know-how and creative flair. You look radically through the eyes of the user and develop beneficial and innovative solutions that make our everyday lives easier and, above all, better. Therefore, service and experience design are just as much your playing field as the classic strategy repertoire. You have a keen sense for brands and their business challenges in the digital age. And you have outstanding communicative and methodical skills and an analytical and inspiring mind.

  - With our diverse backgrounds, we manage to understand our clients, our
    clients' clients, colleagues and bots, connect them and translate the
    different requirements and "languages"
  - As diverse and varied as our backgrounds and skills are, so is the role you
    take on as a strategist. You shape your own role and place
requirements:
  - Passion for digital topics - from use cases, vision setting to
    organisational structures
  - 2-4 years of strategy or service design experience at an agency or in the
    field of strategic customer consulting in a management consultancy
  - Enjoy working in multi-disciplinary agency and client teams with a deep
    understanding of a highly agile work environment
  - Strong interest and experience in communication formats and storytelling to
    bring complex issues closer to different stakeholder groups
  - Experience in creating convincing presentations and workshop set-ups – and
    successfully representing them in front of the clients
  - Very good German and/or English skills
offers:
  - Exciting and innovative projects for well-known companies
  - Varied tasks and space for personal responsibility
  - Professional and personal development
  - A pleasant working atmosphere and short decision-making processes

    program, Employee Referral Program, and more)
