description: >-
  SinnerSchrader Swipe is a studio focusing on digital product management, user
  interface design and software engineering, based in Hamburg, Berlin and
  Zurich. We develop Maximum Loveable Products - radically user-centric services
  with a focus on mobile touchpoints. Our core competencies are experience
  design, strategy and mobile engineering for iOS and Android. Our portfolio
  includes companies from the mobility, automotive, lifestyle and
  telecommunications sectors. Well-known customers include Audi, Motel One, VW
  and Telefónica.


  We are currently looking for a Strategist (f/m/x/-) for our Zurich office.


  We’re looking for strategists who want to unlock potential for experiences that matter.  Strategists who design and revolutionize the digital platforms of tomorrow on the basis of sound methods, professional know-how and creative intuition. You are the kind of person who looks radically through the eyes of the user and develops beneficial and innovative solutions that make everyday life simpler and – above all – better. You are therefore equally at ease with service and experience design as you are with the standard strategy repertoire. You have a keen sense of brands and their business challenges in the digital age. You also have excellent communication and methodical skills in addition to an analytical and inspiring mind.
expectations:
  - As diverse and varied as our backgrounds and skills are, so is the role you
    take on as a strategist. You shape your own role and place
requirements:
  - Passion for digital topics - from use cases, vision setting to
    organisational structures
  - 2-4 years of strategy or service design experience at an agency or in the
    field of strategic customer consulting in a management consultancy
  - Enjoy working in multi-disciplinary agency and client teams with a deep
    understanding of a highly agile work environment
  - Strong interest and experience in communication formats and storytelling to
    bring complex issues closer to different stakeholder groups
  - Experience in creating convincing presentations and workshop set-ups – and
    successfully representing them in front of the clients
  - Very good German and/or English skills
offers:
  - Exciting and innovative projects for well-known companies
  - Varied tasks and space for personal responsibility
  - Professional and personal development
  - A pleasant working atmosphere and short decision-making processes
  - Great benefits (Accident insurance, Workers Council, Employer share purchase
    program, Employee Referral Program, and more)
