title: SinnerSchrader Mobile verstärkt Kreation mit Iker Ortiz de Arri
content: <div class="newsbody"><p>Wir heißen Iker als neuen Senior UX Designer herzlich Willkommen in der Kreation von SinnerSchrader Mobile. Dazu haben wir dem gebürtigen Spanier ein paar Fragen gestellt&#58;</p><p></p><h3>Hi Iker, please tell us something about yourself!</h3><p>Born in the Basque country (north of Spain), but my big curiosity and need for adventure took me out of my comfort zone, moving initially to Belgium where I stayed for 8 years and now living in crazy/cool Berlin. Autodidact by nature, my mission is to create a great user experience while designing easy to use interfaces. </p><p></p><h3>Why did you apply for SinnerSchrader Mobile?</h3><p>I wanted to be part of an agency focused on everything related to mobile developments&#58; apps, responsive websites, wearables and new technologies. In this context SinnerSchrader Mobile seemed like the most reliable option in many aspects, so now I am really excited to be part of the company!</p><p></p><h3>What was the greatest highlight in your life so far?</h3><p>Life is full of small highlights, so it is difficult to select one. I think the biggest highlight (+ most difficult decision ever) was to move to another country, saying goodbye to family and friends to discover other cultures, other languages, etc. It was extremely rewarding.</p><p></p><h3>Best movie I have ever seen</h3><p>I am a very visual person, so I appreciate a lot of good cinematography, also sound editing. I can't select a single movie (as I have seen so many), but I am a big fan of Christopher Nolan, David Fincher (also as a music video director), Darren Aronofsky, David Lynch and Steven Spielberg. But who isn´t? Pixar movies could easily be in my top 10.</p><p></p><h3>Please complete the following&#58; „The day (really) starts, if…"</h3><p>The day (really) starts, if the coffee machine is not broken &#58;)</p><p></p><h3>My motto is&#58;</h3><p>"Less words, more action!"</p><p></p><h3>What will do you do best case in 10 years?</h3><p>Continue working with the same passion as now, surrounded by nice and interesting colleagues.</p><p></p><h3>What in worst case?</h3><p>I prefer to think positive &#58;)</p><p></p><h3>From my childhood on I still have...</h3><p>…an immense sense of curiosity and honesty, and a bit of naiveté.</p><p></p><h3>In 30 years I will...</h3><p>Retire and go back to San Sebastian, my hometown, an amazing place for retirement.</p><p></p><h3>When I want to have fun, I…</h3><p>When I want to have fun, I try too hard. It is better when fun comes unexpected &#58;)</p><p></p><h3>My favorite app is...</h3><p>My favorite app is the one, which is kept simple rather than bombastic design, offering a quick and easy way to accomplish my tasks and comes with small surprises not needed but appreciated.</p><p></p><h3>Without mobile…</h3><p>Without mobile, I panic &#58;)</p><p></p><h3>3 things I would take to a lonely island&#58;</h3><p>My mobile, a satellite dish antenna for WIFI and 3G reception and a solar battery charger &#58;)</p><p></p><h3>I would never ever…</h3><p>I would never ever betray my intuition. Every time I did in the past, I regretted it later.</p></div>
