title: Why digital business need business anthropology - 5 questions to Lilith Wacker
content: <div class="newsbody"> <p>In hiring its first business anthropologist Lilith Wacker, SinnerSchrader is underscoring the value and need for a thorough understanding of people in order to achieve the best customer experience. <br/> Lilith, for her part, was looking for a company in Germany that was open to applying a new set of skills and tools to achieve this goal. (She is also very happy to be able to work in Hamburg, one of the most beautiful cities in Europe.)</p> <p><strong>How would you explain your job as a business anthropologist in a few sentences?</strong></p> <p>As a business anthropologist, I help companies gain an in-depth understanding of people. This is important for companies that want to remain innovative and relevant in the future. In particular, business anthropologists help ensure that people’s real needs inform strategic decision-making at organisations and companies.<br/> The goal is to transform these needs into useful company services and products that are then in turn accepted and adapted by people, i.e. that are actually used.<br/> My colleagues and I do this on the basis of expertise from the human sciences, such as anthropology, sociology, philosophy, cultural and political science and economics.<br/> One of the most important methodologies for acquiring this in-depth understanding is ethnographic research, which I plan, implement and analyse with an interdisciplinary team. And you also need experience with companies’ highly strategic processes, so that the work of translating between people and business can be done usefully for everybody involved.</p> <p><strong>What exactly does that have to do with our business?</strong></p> <p>At SinnerSchrader as a partner to companies in the digital transformation, it is essentially about two major sociocultural phenomena – <br/> technology and data. The interesting thing about sociocultural phenomena is that, historically speaking, they have always been around. Over time, these phenomena are experienced, contextualised and perceived differently, both by people and by organisations and companies.<br/> I’ll give you two examples&#58;<br/> Before digitalisation, technology was static and mostly exclusive to companies. That meant that people who wanted to consume products and services with the exclusive technology were clearly dependent on these companies. On the other hand, technology represented a clear competitive advantage for companies. The new world of digitalisation has led to a democratisation of technology that gives people enormous power in making decisions, which is wonderful. <br/> Then there are two types of data. First, this is pure data&#58; facts and figures that describe what people do, I go shopping here and there, I have been on holiday here and there. And then there is our understanding of this data&#58; why do people do what they do? You can have a huge amount of data, but without the associated contextual understanding it is often worthless as far as reaching decisions on a topic is concerned.<br/> In the context of many SinnerSchrader projects, it is therefore essential to do this basic contextual research first so that digital transformation can then be supported with the companies in a meaningful and respectful way.</p> <p><strong>From the perspective of a business anthropologist, why do we need change, transformation, cultural change?</strong></p> <p>Cultural change will keep happening as long as life goes on; it is part of evolution.<br/> From a BA perspective, companies that want to tackle change and transformation need to have a contextual understanding of what this change means to people. To gain this, you should accompany people in their daily lives and look and listen carefully in order to bring about a change in perspective. This is an iterative process&#58; You should keep asking “why” until you can really understand a connection or a perspective. This then establishes the basis on which change and its significance to people can be understood.<br/> Only on this basis can good, sustainable change come about. Without understanding, people will not help shape the change, and change on the basis of false assumptions and hypotheses can bring it to a complete halt in the long term. This is often the reason why innovations do not work – somewhere in the process, there has been an error in understanding perspectives. </p> <p><strong>What interests and inspires you in your daily life?</strong></p> <p>What really motivates me is my work! What I have learned from and with the people that I have accompanied is that we all have a reason for the things we do. This forces me to change my perspective, which results in a relaxed attitude to life. I feel very fortunate to be able to talk to people as part of my job.<br/> As well as this, I am motivated by social phenomena such as sustainability, ethical issues, and how we humans can find common ground to live together peacefully.<br/> I feel inspired by music and fine arts – and by nature.</p> <p><strong>What is your favourite example of the successful application of business anthropology?</strong></p> <p>In the field of urban development, the Danish architect Jan Gehl understood long ago that cities should be designed and planned on the basis of people’s needs. Scandinavia is generally very “BA-savvy”. <br/> <br/> So it is no surprise that, for example, Sweden managed to reduce emissions with a carbon tax faster than other European countries. The people there accepted this tax increase because other “unpopular” types of tax were lowered or scrapped in return. <br/> It is a question of people’s perspectives and priorities.<br/> <br/> The big tech titans are also starting to understand the value of BA and that it is an important part of looking at the world from a different perspective in order to overcome your own blind spots as a business&#58; <a href="https&#58;//www.ft.com/content/7f5f53e2-08b1-11e9-9fe8-acdb36967cfc" target="_blank">https&#58;//www.ft.com/content/7f5f53e2-08b1-11e9-9fe8-acdb36967cfc</a></p> </div>
