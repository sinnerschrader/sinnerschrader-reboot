content: <div class="newsbody"><p><strong>Zurich, 16 February 2021&#58;</strong> As part of Accenture Interactive, Swipe, the mobile studio of SinnerSchrader, is opening another office in Zurich, alongside Berlin and Hamburg. The studio focuses on the design and implementation of mobile experiences. </p><p>"We also see a strong need for digital products as well as ecosystems in Switzerland, and the location expansion is part of SinnerSchrader's overall growth strategy. Swipe has been continuously growing for years and I am excited about the new opportunities through an expanded digital offering in Switzerland under the partnership umbrella of Accenture Interactive," says Sven Schmiede, Co-Founder of Swipe and Managing Director SinnerSchrader.</p><p>Lorenz Vierecke, Studio Lead Swipe, adds&#58; "Our way of working has fundamentally evolved in the pandemic, and we also accompany clients very closely across countries from Berlin and Hamburg in the implementation of digital product strategies. However, in order to sustainably place transformational products in a market like Switzerland, you also need a deep understanding of the market, which is hard to build from a distance."</p><p>With Wim Roelfs, Swipe Zurich has been able to win another highly experienced creative in the areas of digital, communication and brand. Roelfs was most recently Digital Creative Director at MetaDesign AG and previously worked at Publicis, Jung von Matt LIMMAT AG and Futurecom Interactive AG.

In addition to the Stop Corona app in Austria, the first contract tracing app in Europe, various other digital solutions to combat the pandemic are being developed nationally and at the country level. </p><p><strong>About SinnerSchrader</strong><br/>SinnerSchrader is one of Europe's leading digital agencies focusing on the design and development of digital products and services.
