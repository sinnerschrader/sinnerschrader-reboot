title: Advisors solve problems with the left and the right side of their brains
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><strong>In his role as Director Advisory, Fabian Tönnesmann aligns the interests of clients' top management with the user-centred digital product roadmap. He is thus actively shaping the digital transformation for clients in conjunction with their executive management. <br/>We asked him a few questions about this&#58;</strong></p><p><strong>Fabian, you are the first Director Advisory at SinnerSchrader. <br/>Why is now the right time for this?</strong></p><p>I think the best answer to this is our book on the development of transformational products. The book positions SinnerSchrader as a digital product manufacturer that actually transforms companies by successfully developing digital products.<br/>Two things are important here&#58; developing user relevant products, and ultimately linking them with the company's available assets, i.e. integrating them in the economic and cultural context. Advisory is about communicating, enabling and integrating insights, interests and factors in both directions&#58; to the users and to the stakeholders in the company. Also, this often involves adjusting existing business models or developing new ones.</p><p><strong>What kind of expertise needs to be applied in order to complete a job of this kind?</strong></p><p>Advisors who like to solve problems with the left and right sides of their brain are challenged here&#58; it is necessary to apply a highly user-centred understanding in terms of digital products and their development as well as a strong commercial interest in terms of the actions, structure and functionality of companies. A high level of empathy for both worlds generates access.<br/>Degrees such as business IT or economics in combination with communication or social sciences are particularly useful here.</p><p><strong>Are there specific sectors that particularly need you right now in the context of digitalisation?</strong></p><p>I wouldn't say that there is one specific sector. Lots of companies need to act now in order to avoid losing momentum and market share to the new digital competitors. Companies are now under pressure to innovate, and there is pent-up demand in the financial services, automotive, retail and telecommunications industries, in the energy sector, in fact wherever there are major challenges in integrating digital customer interfaces at the heart of the company.</p><p><strong>Many firms are buying the “advisory” service and thus also ceding responsibility as a company - why does that make so much sense?</strong></p><p>Essentially, the level of complexity in terms of digitalisation issues within large corporations is very high indeed – nearly all functions need to be involved and cooperate. Corporations benefit from being perceived as highly motivated&#58;<br/>There is the <strong>inspiration</strong> from outside, which can often lead to the disruption required to get things done. Then there is also an <strong>involvement in digital issues</strong> that can be achieved via co-creation. Often, the management does not have many internal allies, and joins forces with external advisors to create a team with digital kindred spirits, almost a small start-up, that helps them to enthuse stakeholders, and build and integrate new products or even a new business model together. And of course, <strong>knowledge transfer</strong> of new skills, tools and mindsets takes place.</p><p><strong>What has to be done to get as many people as possible in the company on board?</strong></p><p>Integrating in product development co-creatively from the outset, showing them new ways and, above all, letting them experience it. Only then will change be effective. People are also managers here. And via ownership among these stakeholders, starting up the system and establishing interdisciplinary digital product development among executive management.</p><p><strong>What are you especially proud of in your career so far?</strong></p><p>That's an interesting question. I'm actually proud of having supported an energy corporation and helped it to think strategically from the customer's perspective rather than that of the market.</p><p><strong>And how do you switch off when you put your device down?</strong></p><p>Usually with sport. I always go for a run in the evening. That's the physical “wind-down”, then the mental switching-off starts through classical music (OK, I need a device again for that ;-))!</p><p><a class="news-backlink" href="/en/"><svg class="svg-ico svg-ico--arrow-left"><use xlink&#58;href="#arrow-down"></use></svg>Back to the overview</a></p></div>
