title: Anheuser-Busch InBev Awards Digital Budget for Beck’s
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><strong>SinnerSchrader supporting leading beer brand from 1 January 2014<br/></strong></p><p>Anheuser-Busch InBev has chosen a new partner for the digital communication of its Beck’s brand in Germany. SinnerSchrader, Hamburg, clearly asserted itself in the pitch. Its area of responsibility comprises Beck’s digital brand presence, taking care of all digital channels and the digital activation of brand campaigns. The first work is scheduled to go online in spring 2014; a key aim is to increase fan involvement. “According to ‘Markenmonitor Bier’ (the brand monitor for beer), Beck’s is the most popular beer brand in Germany. In spite of the outstanding development of the brand values we have decided to take the next step to further develop the brand progressively.”</p><p>Nils Wollny, Managing Director Strategy at SinnerSchrader&#58; “The acquisition of Beck’s is the best start to the year that we could wish for ourselves. We are proud of immediately supporting one of the German brands that is known all over the world and of helping to further develop its communication in the years ahead, together with the customer.”</p><p>Coma had been responsible for Beck’s digital marketing since 2007. The Company would like to thank the Munich company for the excellent cooperation. Coma will continue to support Anheuser-Busch InBev for the brands Franziskaner and Hasseröder. </p><p><strong>About Beck’s&#58;</strong><br/>Alongside Stella Artois, Corona and Budweiser, Beck’s is one of the four global brands of the Anheuser-Busch InBev brewery group, which has its headquarters for Germany, Austria, Italy and Switzerland in Bremen. Beck’s is available in more than 80 countries on five continents. Around 3,000 bottles of Beck’s are drunk around the world every minute. </p></div>
