title: Audi demonstrates innovation with digital services
content: <div class="newsbody"> <p><strong>First place in 2018 Forrester Digital Experience Survey / 2018 Auto Bild configurator test winner / Best results in Autohaus study</strong></p> <p><strong>Hamburg, September 2018</strong> – A few days before the launch of the Audi e-tron, the German brand’s first fully electric SUV, the Ingolstadt-based company has been illustrating how it is making progress through digital services. A recent Forrester study named Audi as the strongest performer in European automotive websites, highlighting the progress that it has made in transforming itself and clearly demonstrating its long-term strategy with regard to the digital experience. Audi secured the top spot in Forrester’s Digital Experience Survey.</p> <p>The results of the study, entitled ‘Automotive Wave&#58; European Websites, Q3 2018’, attest to the digital Audi experience of giving users the right offers and thereby providing them with plenty of help in making a decision. In particular, the website experience scored very well in terms of user experience score and functionality – the latter by some margin over the competition. </p> <p>This is not the only evidence that the company has successfully chosen the right strategic direction for its digital transformation. Auto Bild has also recently declared Audi a winner in 2018 tests for its configurator – a centrepiece of its current digital commerce strategy.</p> <p>Not only that, but according to a recent Autohaus study, Audi has also dealt impressively with the question of how much support consumers can receive in selecting their ideal equipment configuration online and how customised configurations can best be passed on to dealerships.</p> <p>‘This is an accomplishment that makes us proud, because our users are the reason we are constantly working to improve our digital services,’ commented Dieter Kopitzki, head of Website Development &amp; Roll-out at Audi. </p> <p>The Audi configurator was conceived as an integrated system from the outside, with users only ever one click away from configuring their vehicles. Meanwhile, links to other Audi data pools are established in the background. For example, users can be shown genuine, customised offers in their areas in real time. </p> <p>‘For us and our agency partners, these findings make for exceptional feedback about our shared ambition of taking on a leading role in providing a digital experience. They show that we are putting our innovations to excellent use in meeting the expectations of users in terms of design, service and performance,’ explained Nils Wollny, head of digital business strategy &amp; customer experience at Audi. ‘Yet at the same time, the results motivate us to keep up our efforts to make progress and set new digital standards across multiple industries.’</p> <p>Since 2016, SinnerSchrader has been the lead digital agency worldwide responsible not only for developing digital, user-focused services for Audi but also for managing a range of other service providers. For the agency, too, Audi’s superlative performance in the various rankings is compelling evidence that working with Audi is the right way to go.</p> <p>‘First and foremost, this is an achievement for every single member of our growing cross-functional Audi team,’ said Philipp Kafkoulas and Dr Axel Averdung, creative and strategic managers at SinnerSchrader. ‘We believe in systematically adopting user perspectives, data-driven product innovation and the idea that seamlessly interwoven digital touchpoints can bring tangible benefits to both customers and businesses.’</p> <p><strong>About SinnerSchrader</strong><br/> SinnerSchrader is one of the leading digital agencies in Europe with a focus on the design and development of digital products and services.
