title: Audi implements platform for online car sales with SinnerSchrader
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><strong>SinnerSchrader takes a major step towards digital car sales for Audi Deutschland with an interdisciplinary team</strong></p><p><strong>Hamburg, December 2017</strong> – In its role as Audi’s digital lead agency, SinnerSchrader has implemented a major e-commerce project in record time – an initial milestone of the newly developed, comprehensive commerce strategy for digital car sales. The platform for online vehicle sales enables users to find a pre-owned Audi that suits their needs and to complete the purchase directly and entirely online. </p><p>Together with the stakeholders, which include the individual Audi partners, Audi Markt Deutschland and Audi Bank as well as Audi itself, an application with an optimal customer journey was developed to allow for straightforward, quick and integrated car sales. Throughout the process, SinnerSchrader and Audi applied a development philosophy with an uncompromising focus on the user. </p><p>“Users expect relevant service and tangible added value. Our goal was to make this our consistent focus and develop a beneficial customer experience. Interfaces and processes retreat into the background in a very intuitive experience for the user.”  – Stefan Kroke, Executive Director, SinnerSchrader</p><p>In order to achieve this, an agile process was launched, with SinnerSchrader putting together an interdisciplinary team that worked on site with the product owners at Audi. The jointly formulated requirements were tested in use labs and the results derived from this continuously influenced the next stage of the project by way of fast and agile adjustments. In this way, a transformational product with understandable and user-friendly application options was developed. </p><p>“It is the users alone who decide on the success of this project – so we are glad that we always had them around the table with us thanks to our prototype-based work. We are already looking forward to the next expansion stage.” – Marcus Keith, Audi AG</p><p>Several additional functions for the application are planned for the future, and the platform is also to be rolled out in other countries. </p><p><strong>The team at SinnerSchrader&#58;</strong><br/>Design lead&#58; Philipp von Essen<br/>Product design&#58; Yuri Ziebell, Markus Ölhafen, Lukas Simon, Tilman Frick<br/>Product engineers&#58; Florian Niebuhr, Mario Nebl, Georg Hemprich<br/>Product management&#58; Tamara Bianco, Norman Kreikemeier</p><p><strong>The team at Audi&#58;</strong><br/>Marius Kohlhepp<br/>Miriam Abel<br/>Zita Riesberg<br/>Andreas Gruber<br/>Adrian Gluchow</p><p><strong>Others involved&#58;</strong><br/>Audi Business Innovation<br/>42dp</p><p></p><p>SinnerSchrader has been the international lead agency for Audi since 2016 and supports its customer in a studio established specifically for this purpose.
