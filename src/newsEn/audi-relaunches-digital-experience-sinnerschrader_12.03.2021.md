title: Audi relaunches digital experience with SinnerSchrader
content: <div class="newsbody"><ul><li>Next step in the systematic improvement of the digital experience offers premium quality in terms of design, personalisation and e-commerce. Audi sets new standards for the user experience </li><li>Collaborative creation of a global software delivery pipeline between SinnerSchrader and Audi with agile remote-first set-up</li></ul><p><strong>Hamburg, March 2021.</strong> Audi is taking a systematic approach to digitalisation. The latest step involves transforming its digital brand identity. The digital experience will accompany the launch of the Audi e-tron GT by visualising the ideas that will shape the company to an even greater extent in future. The new website has a simplified design that enables easy navigation and improves vehicle configuration. The relaunch of the online experience is the result of a partnership between SinnerSchrader and Audi that extends from strategy and design through to implementation.</p><p>One of the aims is to give the product visualisation of Audi’s new electric flagship an immersive quality. The idea is for the user to get to know every detail of the vehicle interactively through appealing visuals that communicate Audi’s premium standard. In addition to a modular micro-service architecture, a new software solution has been implemented that offers a significantly more high-performance environment than ever before, while also generating synergy potential across the various VW core brands.</p><p>The new Audi online experience has a lightweight, simplified design that enables easy navigation, establishes innovative functions and harmonises the connection to all online services, including the myAudi app. Interactive modules and animations, including visually exciting scroll-in-text and zoom-in-text modules and sound visualisations, allow users to immerse themselves in all of the vehicle’s highlights.</p><p>Another highlight of the relaunch is systematic personalisation. The aim is for users to be able to get to where they want to be quickly and take advantage of e-commerce offers for all Audi products and services easily – including via a new central login function. The new Audi Customizer is another example. As a starting point, users can select their individual preferences for their car with just a few clicks. They are then immediately shown the location of a dealer where they can take a test drive or where they can find vehicles that are in stock right now. These personalised services are already available in Germany, Norway, Sweden and Spain and are being rolled out to the websites for other markets.</p><p>“The Audi e-tron GT is a highly emotional product that sets a clear statement for the future of the Four Rings. To accompany the product presentation, we are substantially improving Audi’s digital customer experience by seamlessly combining relevant content, an intuitive experience and data-driven personalisation,” commented Sven Schuwirth, Head of Digital Experience and Business at AUDI AG. “SinnerSchrader is an ideal partner and never allows design to come at the expense of technological excellence or vice versa. Together, we have created a high-performance software delivery pipeline to supply digital products that are quickly and easily scalable.”</p><p>By introducing a new remote-first model at an early stage in the partnership, we were able to work with international teams of developers from different markets easily and remotely, take full account of local requirements and respond quickly to the rapidly changing circumstances as a result of COVID-19.</p><p>Philipp Kafkoulas, Managing Director for Design at SinnerSchrader with responsibility for overall creation&#58; “Despite the lockdown, we worked intensively with Audi across continents to quickly and effectively develop new software that offers a unique brand experience. This is something that requires real trust and agility on both sides and a shared understanding of design. The result&#58; Audi offers excellent value added for its users as well as data-driven e-commerce. As an agency, we are proud to have once again partnered with Audi as equals to jointly design a highly productive digital environment.”</p><p>The new features were led from SinnerSchrader’s Hamburg office. Together with Philipp Kafkoulas, Arndt Allmeling, Dr. Axel Averdung, Philip Behr and Stefan Kroke are responsible for the results of the interdisciplinary team.</p><p><strong>About SinnerSchrader</strong><br/>SinnerSchrader has been the global lead digital agency for Audi since 2016. This close cooperation has already given rise to more than fifty integrated projects based on a jointly developed overarching experience strategy and established the leading digital ecosystem for premium mobility and digital services from Audi.</p></div>
