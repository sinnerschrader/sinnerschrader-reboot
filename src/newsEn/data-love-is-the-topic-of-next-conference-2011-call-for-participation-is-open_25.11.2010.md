title: Data Love is the topic of NEXT Conference 2011 / Call for Participation is open
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><strong>NEXT11, taking place on May 17 &amp; 18, will assemble about 2,000 participants from the Internet, marketing, advertising, and technology industries in Berlin. The most important European conference for the digital economy will focus on the interactive consumer and the question of how he uses the web today and will use it tomorrow.</strong></p><p>NEXT11’s topic will be “Data Love”. The programme creators around Matthias Schrader, founder and CEO of SinnerSchrader, chose the subject to emphasize the significance of data as the driving factor of digital value creation. As of now, people interested in participating on stage can apply for the sought-after speaking opportunities or propose any other speaker for the various conference tracks.</p><p>According to Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google, there were five exabytes of information created between the birth of the world and 2003, the same amount that’s now created every two days. Pictures, videos, geographical data –the commercial processing of existing data from the increasingly mobile web mainly serves one purpose&#58; offering relevant products and services to the consumer.</p><p>Business developers, marketing professionals and agencies face the challenge of developing new applications with additional benefits for the consumer from the almost unmanageable data stream. In the data driven economy, the consumer and his behaviour determine the success of products and services in real-time –with huge consequences for innovation cycles, optimisation of products and services, marketing and sales.</p><p>Learning to understand the interactive consumer and his behaviour</p><p>On two conference days the participants of NEXT11 come to know everything about the interactive consumer and his future usage of the web. Best practice examples will show how data streams and digital technologies can be used expediently for e-commerce, advertising or marketing. Trends and visionaries from all over the world, workshops as well as special events complete the whole programme of about 50 hours.</p><p>For the speaker selection, the organisers rely on the international Programme Director Monique van Dusseldorp, well known experts on the main topics and the NEXT community. With the Call for Participation, the digital economy is asked to apply with own topics for speaking opportunities and to select the best suggestions.</p><p>NEXT 2011&#58; Melting pot of Europe’s digital economy</p><p>The new voting platform offers the community the opportunity to choose the best proposals among the presented topics and suggested speakers. “We want the best minds of the digital economy to enter the stage of NEXT11, “ Matthias Schrader points out the goal. „For the commercial web, Germany is the most important market within Europe. This significance should be reflected by the conference landscape. We invite the digital economy to take an active part in this process.“</p><p>Having relocated the conference from Hamburg to Berlin this year, the organisers SinnerSchrader and STATION-Berlin have already accomplished the conditions for a further internationalisation of the event, which was first launched in 2006. This path is to be pursued consequently in 2011. “Berlin as the melting pot between Eastern and Western Europe is the perfect location and the most attractive city in Europe for speakers as well as participants.“</p><p>Further information on NEXT11 can be found at <a href="http&#58;//www.nextconf.eu">www.nextconf.eu</a> and on the Call for Participation at <a href="vote.nextconf.eu">vote.nextconf.eu</a>.</p><p><a class="news-backlink" href="/en/"><svg class="svg-ico svg-ico--arrow-left"><use xlink&#58;href="#arrow-down"></use></svg>Back to the overview</a></p></div>
