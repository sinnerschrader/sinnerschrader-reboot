title: Drogerie Mueller boosts their online activitiy with their new webshop
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><a href="http&#58;//shop.mueller.de/" target="_blank">http&#58;//shop.mueller.de</a></p><p>Right on time for the holiday shopping season, Müller opened their new online shop  <a href="http&#58;//www.shop.mueller.de/">www.shop.mueller.de</a> for the German market on 29.11.2013. For the first phase, Müller has more than 20,000 products on offer in their multimedia, toy and perfume departments.  The new shop provides customers with an around the clock shopping experience.</p><p>"Müller developed the online store in record time in close cooperation with service provider Commerce Plus. In just eight months, existing systems were adapted and entirely new systems were developed to enable this innovative business model," comments Alexander Kornegger, Director of E-commerce at Müller.</p><p>Starting off the first phase, Müller offers over 20,000 products in the perfume, toys and multimedia departments.<br/>The online order process is simple. With the "click &amp; collect model", the customer selects the desired products, places them in a virtual shopping cart and confirms the order. The customer then selects a local store, where they wish to pick up their order. As soon as the order arrives at the designated store, the customer receives email notification and pays as usual at checkout in their local store.<br/>Unlike their competitors, Müller directs their online traffic into local stores, thereby supporting their offline business. This new online  distribution channel offers Müller customers the opportunity to access a wider range of products than their local store may offer.</p><p>The Müller Group guarantees its customers a price advantage, should the price of an item change between online order placement and in-store pick-up. Should a product be more expensive at pick-up time, the customer will not pay more. On the same token, customers will profit from any price reduction prior to pick-up.</p><p>Müller customers can compare prices between the online shop and retail stores and will always benefit from the best price, true to Müller's motto "Compare our prices!"</p><p>Müller is meeting the needs of its customers who wish to shop outside of local store hours and who appreciate the delivery service and picking up perfectly packed products in their local store.</p><p>In addition, customers of local stores which have a smaller range of products will benefit from the large online offer.</p><p>Customers with also find the unique experience of shopping at their local store in the new online shop.  Commerce Plus explored the product-driven look of the store interiors and interpreted this look for the design of the online store. The products are grouped in three departments&#58; perfumes, multimedia and toys. Each department has its own character&#58; the perfume shop is sophisticated, the toy shop is colorful and the multimedia shop is technically cool.</p><p>"With a well-designed cross-channel strategy and inspiring online shopping experience, Müller is on its way to adapting its store concept to online." said Moritz Koch, Managing Director at Commerce Plus.</p><p>Behind the scenes is the e-commerce platform Magento. FACT-Finder offers a comprehensive search, filtering options and an auto-suggest feature. Users may make use of various list display options and filter their desired product group on the list page of each department. The user may place any product in their shopping bag with just one click in the quick-shopping layer which opens via mouse-over.</p><p><a class="news-backlink" href="/en/"><svg class="svg-ico svg-ico--arrow-left"><use xlink&#58;href="#arrow-down"></use></svg>Back to the overview</a></p></div>
