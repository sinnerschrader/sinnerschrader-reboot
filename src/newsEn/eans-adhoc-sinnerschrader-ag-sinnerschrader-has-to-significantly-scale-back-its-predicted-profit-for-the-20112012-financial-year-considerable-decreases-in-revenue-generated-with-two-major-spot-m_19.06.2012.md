These events had not been foreseeable both with respect to the magnitude of the reductions as well as with respect to the fact that they occurred at the same time. Based on current knowledge, these are lasting reductions, which means that for the coming quarters as well, spot-media AG revenues will be approximately one-third lower than those of the first two quarters of the 2011/2012 financial year.</p><p>For the 2011/2012 financial year, spot-media AG will fall short of its turnover forecast by more than 1.5 million euros. Restructuring measures with respect to capacity adjustment are thus unavoidable and are being promptly initiated.</p><p>In view of this development, SinnerSchrader has to downgrade its predicted profit for the 2011/2012 financial year. Depending on the scenario, expectations with respect to EBITA for the current financial year range from 1.3 million to 2 million euros. This would fall far short of the 3.25 million euros originally forecast, in addition to falling short of the 2.6 million euros generated during the previous year. Nevertheless, SinnerSchrader will achieve its forecast sales, at 35.5 million euros.</p><p>SinnerSchrader believes that the developments at spot-media AG are not an indication of a general decline in dynamics in the market for digital marketing.</p><p>On 12 July 2012, SinnerSchrader will be publishing details on the third quarter and the first nine months of the 2011/2012 financial year as well as an outlook for the year as a whole in its third 2011/2012 quarterly report.</p><p><strong>About SinnerSchrader</strong><br/>SinnerSchrader is one of the leading digital agencies in Europe.
