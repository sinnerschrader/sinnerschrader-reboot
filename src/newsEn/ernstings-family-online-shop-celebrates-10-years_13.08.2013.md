Create your Famy. Ernsting's family and Commerce Plus creating and developing the idea.</p><p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-39aedbde-860d-1c76-aada-76cff49839c7">This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Ernsting's family online shop,<a href="http&#58;//www.ernstings-family.de/" target="_blank"> www.ernstings-family.de</a>. The story behind it&#58; In recent years, the shop has evolved into one of the most important sales channels for the Ernsting's family brand. The shop was launched in 2003 with merely eight products. Today the shop ships some 600,000 products per month to online customers.</p><p dir="ltr">Not only has the shop seen positive development as a distribution channel, the online shop has also become known for its customer loyalty activities. Today, the online store maintains a high volume of return customers, customers who order regularly and benefit from special offers and promotions and have a strong identification with the brand world of Ernsting's family. Ernsting’s consistent pursuit of increasing sales and improving customer loyalty has led to the shop’s success. The e-commerce agency Commerce Plus has been supporting the online shop since 2009.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="http&#58;//aktionen.ernstings-family.de/10-Jahre" target="_blank">http&#58;//aktionen.ernstings-family.de/10-Jahre</a></p><p dir="ltr">Commemorating their 10-year anniversary, together with Commerce Plus the fashion brand has once again come up with a special treat for their customers. From August 12 - 23, shoppers can create a one-of-a-kind Famy community. Commerce Plus developed the so-called “Famy” generator, which customers can use to create a virtual image of their family. "The idea originated as we considered modern digital identification and discovered avatar culture for the campaign. We then directed the concept toward families and created an online tool that is a lot of fun," Daniela Wiegers, Account Manager at Commerce Plus, reflects on the campaign’s development.</p><p dir="ltr">There are many characteristics to choose from, so that users may create detailed avatars, called Famys. From different hairdos to body size and shape to mouth and eye features and of course apparel, a unique Famy may be born. For added enjoyment, the possible combinations are limitless, even a child can sport a moustache. The tool allows every user to design up to seven family members. The campaign involves shoppers in a playful interactive way, integrating them as part of the family. In addition, users may share their Famys over Facebook. All submitted Famys will become part of a unique Famy collage. The continually growing collage will be documented and presented via photos over the course of the campaign. The result will be one big happy family, which anyone can become a part of.</p><p dir="ltr">Employees at Ernsting's family have generated their own Famys which are part of the online community and reveal anecdotes about their daily work. The campaign includes a contest whose first prize is a travel voucher for 4000 euros. Various surprise events will pop up during the campaign to ensure that users actively return to visit the shop. The campaign is being promoted via in-store print ads and via online promotion.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="http&#58;//www.commerce-plus.com/files/2013/08/Famylaeum_Ernstingsfamily_ComPlus_KeyVisual300dpi.jpg" target="_blank">Download the key visual of the campaign in 300dpi.</a></p><p><a class="news-backlink" href="/en/"><svg class="svg-ico svg-ico--arrow-left"><use xlink&#58;href="#arrow-down"></use></svg>Back to the overview</a></p></div>
