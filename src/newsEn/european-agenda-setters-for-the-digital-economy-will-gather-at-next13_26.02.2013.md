Says NEXT Chairman Matthias Schrader, whose agency SinnerSchrader will organise NEXT Berlin for the eighth time&#58; "Digitisation puts many businesses under a lot of pressure. All sectors of our economy and society will experience radical transformations in the years to come. Start-ups and established companies alike will need to adapt to numerous digital innovations to boost their business. Those who don’t learn to ride the dragons risk being swallowed!”</p><p>NEXT Berlin has always been about “What’s next?”. NEXT13 focuses sharply on those areas worth observing, exploring and capturing over the upcoming 12 to 36 months. These are, for example, invisible technologies, new interfaces, the growing significance of context through smarter things, data and services, 3D printing and the Maker Movement. Start-ups are often pioneers in terms of adding creative ideas to technical innovations. So NEXT will again pay special attention to European Start-ups by giving them a unique platform on both conference days. Together with its incubator, Deutsche Telekom will host a complete track which will give Start-ups and their topics a prominent stage. Start-ups can apply to pitch at nextberlin.eu until March 8. The NEXT community and a jury of experts will then decide who will make it to the stage and into the final. Participants will receive a valuable price and a great deal of international attention.</p><p>Tickets are available for 690 Euros (plus tax and fees) at nextberlin.eu/tickets.</p><p>Information on NEXT Berlin, videos of last year's keynote speakers and the NEXT blog about current trends in the digital world can be found at <a href="http&#58;//nextberlin.eu">nextberlin.eu</a>.</p><p><strong>Press Contact<br/></strong><br/>Ina Feistritzer, Public Relations Manager<br/>ina@nextberlin.eu<br/>mobil +49.176.23218293<br/>office +49.40.398855180</p><p>SinnerSchrader Group<br/>Völckersstraße 38<br/>22765 Hamburg<br/>Germany</p><p>Please find press releases, photos and the online-form for press accreditation<br/>at <a href="http&#58;//nextberlin.eu/press">nextberlin.eu/press</a></p><p><strong>About NEXT Berlin<br/></strong>Over the last few years, NEXT Berlin has established itself as an important agenda setter for tomorrow’s topics of the European digital economy.
