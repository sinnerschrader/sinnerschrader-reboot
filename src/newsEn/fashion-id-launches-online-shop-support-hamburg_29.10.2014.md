title: Fashion ID launches online shop with support from Hamburg
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><a href="http&#58;//www.fashion-id.de" target="_blank" title="Commerce Plus launches online flagship store for Parador">fashion-id.de</a></p><p>Fashion ID, Peek &amp; Cloppenburg Düsseldorf’s online shop for brand-name fashion and accessories, has recently restyled and re-launched its platform. Behind the scenes was the Hamburg agency for e-commerce, SinnerSchrader Commerce. The agency was responsible for the online shop’s entire creative reconstruction. The shop’s technical implementation was carried out in-house. SinnerSchrader Commerce inspired Fashion ID with their initial pitch, a solid concept for the display of more than 400 top brand names&#58; "We asked ourselves&#58; How do we transfer 110 years of tradition and fashion expertise into a digital shopping experience," comments Moritz Koch, Managing Director at SinnerSchrader Commerce. With its more than 25,000 products, the shop has significantly evolved in the areas of fashion know-how, user experience, interactivity, “look and feel” and customer loyalty. In addition to providing optimization for all relevant mobile devices, the Hamburg agency gave the premium and editorial sections an entirely new look. At the same time, the customer service section was reconsidered conceptually and customer checkout was optimized. As part of the overall sales concept, the next step will be the expansion of cross-channel integration together with the P&amp;C stores.</p><p></p><p><strong>Downloads&#58;</strong></p><p><a href="https://commerce-plus.com/media/filer_public/8b/05/8b050bc0-038d-4882-b868-5e620f585422/fashionid_screenshotstartseite.jpg" target="_blank">Screenshot Homepage</a></p><p><a href="https://commerce-plus.com/media/filer_public/03/25/032596f1-a4b0-4686-919b-acdcc1bb3ab7/fashion_id_commerceplus.jpg" target="_blank">Picture Fashion ID</a></p><p><a class="news-backlink" href="/en/"><svg class="svg-ico svg-ico--arrow-left"><use xlink&#58;href="#arrow-down"></use></svg>Back to the overview</a></p></div>
