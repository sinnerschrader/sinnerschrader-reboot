title: Fritze named new CD at SinnerSchrader Mobile
content: <div class="newsbody"><p>SinnerSchrader Mobile in Berlin has enhanced its team with the addition of Robert Fritze (30). As a creative director, he will expand the creative team of designers and concept developers that designs and implements mobile solutions for clients such as DuMont Net, comdirect bank, Unitymedia, PUBLISH (Merian, Prinz, Feinschmecker). Fritze comes from iconmobile where he worked for three years, most recently as Creative Lead for various international brands, including Microsoft, Nivea, BMW, Qype, and IBM.</p><p>Robert Fritze&#58; "The Creation department plays a crucial role in mobile development, as mobile contexts can differ very widely. Mobile solutions no longer interact only with traditional media such as the web, print and TV, but will be even more deeply rooted in everyday life in future, for example through connections to the car and home, via on-screen interactive shopping displays, and through NFC (near field communication)."</p><p>Laurent Burdin, CEO of SinnerSchrader Mobile, says&#58; "We are delighted to have gained a top-notch creative in Robert Fritze. He has many years of experience in managing and designing mobile projects, and is an ideal complement to our team."</p><p><strong>About SinnerSchrader Mobile</strong><br/>SinnerSchrader Mobile is a full-service mobile agency in Berlin.
