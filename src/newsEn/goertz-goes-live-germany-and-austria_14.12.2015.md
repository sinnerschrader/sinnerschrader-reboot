The first milestone has been reached&#58; go-live of the new online shops goertz.de and goertz.at.

The new online shop shows what’s currently possible and we are not finished yet!</em>”, SinnerSchrader Commerce CEO Moritz Koch sums up Görtz‘s commitment.</p><img alt="Goertz_Desktop_Smartphone_Ansichten.png" class="full-width filer_image left" src="/media/filer_public/5d/af/5daf3bfc-8e7b-4810-ab02-e4d22d120df2/goertz_desktop_smartphone_ansichten.png" srcset="/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/5d/af/5daf3bfc-8e7b-4810-ab02-e4d22d120df2/goertz_desktop_smartphone_ansichten.png__298x179_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.png 480w, /media/filer_public/5d/af/5daf3bfc-8e7b-4810-ab02-e4d22d120df2/goertz_desktop_smartphone_ansichten.png 481w"/><p>In cooperation with Commerce Plus, Görtz has developed a new e-commerce business model which includes a sourcing strategy visible at go-live.

Every item available in the online shop can also be selected for in-store pick-up at one of their 160 German stores. The customer may return his online purchase in-store or online. Görtz is currently planning the roll-out of individual store availability online and online reservation for in-store pick-up. Görtz also plans to expand and strengthen the integration of its ​​multichannel CRM, so that customers with the Görtz card may not only log in and accrue points with every purchase, but also have direct access to their account online where the may profit from special offers and services.</p><p>Customers will further be able to receive advice from style advisers, specifically targeted to Görtz audiences. Products suggested by a style adviser may then be directly purchased online.
