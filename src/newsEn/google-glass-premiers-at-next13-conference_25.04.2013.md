title: Google Glass premiers at NEXT13 conference
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><strong>Yesterday, the trend conference of the digital economy, <a href="http&#58;//nextberlin.eu">NEXT Berlin</a>, ended successfully. 1,700 participants from around the world attended the two-day event at the Berliner Congress Center. Highlights included the presentation of Google Glass by tech blogger Robert Scoble, the talk of Barack Obama's digital campaign chief Harper Reed and the speech of chancellor candidate Peer Steinbrück. Winner of this year’s start-up-competition was LineMetrics.</strong></p><p>&lt;iframe src="http&#58;//video.nextconf.eu/v.ihtml?source=share&amp;amp;photo%5fid=8052605" height="355" width="500" allowfullscreen="1" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p><p>Crowds of people surrounded the American blogger Robert Scoble when he arrived at NEXT Berlin with one of the first Google Glasses. As one of the first users worldwide, Scoble received the data glasses just a week ago and showed the new gadget for the first time at a European conference. Some of the NEXT visitors were allowed to try on this surprisingly lightweight device.<br/><img alt="8676960113_8d0e4d1d37_b" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2771" height="176" src="http&#58;//www.sinnerschrader.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/8676960113_8d0e4d1d37_b-300x176.jpg" width="300"/><br/>With a tap on the eyeglass frame, one can browse emails or road maps right in front of your eyes, or simply shoot a photo by saying&#58; "Take a picture". What is still in the development stage today, will be mainstream in about two years, predicted the tech expert Robert Scoble. This also applies to other trends that were presented on the three stages of the NEXT Berlin 2013. For example in the Maker Session, which showed how small groups find new ways of production through 3D printing and crowdsourcing.</p><p>Barack Obama's digital expert Harper Reed also inspired the audience with his talk. He and a team of 120 data engineers organised the re-election campaign of the U.S. president by analysing big data for this purpose.</p><p>[caption id="attachment_2772" align="alignright" width="510"]<a href="http&#58;//www.sinnerschrader.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/8676167778_819f179f64_c.jpg"><img alt="Harper Reed - Barack Obama's CTO about the re-election campaign of the U.S. president" class="size-full wp-image-2772" height="326" src="http&#58;//www.sinnerschrader.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/8676167778_819f179f64_c.jpg" width="510"/></a> Harper Reed - Barack Obama's CTO about the re-election campaign of the U.S. president[/caption]</p><p>Analysing big data can be efficient (and affordable) for smaller companies too, as this year’s start-up pitch winner LineMetrics proved with their business idea. The Austrian entrepreneurs Wolfgang Hafenscher and Reinhart Nowak founded LineMetrics a year ago. They presented their product on the NEXT Start-up Stage, which was organised by Deutsche Telekom’s incubator hub&#58;raum. With their toolbox for analysing production lines, LineMetrics really impressed the jury of experts and collected a prize package worth 20,000 Euros. Almost one hundred start-ups from all over Europe took part in the competition.</p><p>[caption id="attachment_2769" align="alignnone" width="510"]<a href="http&#58;//www.sinnerschrader.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/99095-next13_start-up_pitch_winner-xlarge-1366827207.jpg"><img alt="LineMetrics from Austria - this year's NEXT start-up pitch winner" class="wp-image-2769" height="317" src="http&#58;//www.sinnerschrader.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/99095-next13_start-up_pitch_winner-xlarge-1366827207.jpg" width="510"/></a> LineMetrics from Austria - this year's NEXT start-up pitch winner[/caption]</p><p>In total the proportion of international NEXT participants has grown once again to a share of more than 30%. Attendees even travelled from places as far away as China and Brazil to see more than 150 digital trendsetters on three NEXT stages. This is the eighth time that leading digital agency SinnerSchrader has organised the NEXT Berlin conference.</p><p><strong>More information, photos and videos at</strong><a href="http&#58;//nextberlin.eu/press">http&#58;//nextberlin.eu/press</a></p><p><img alt="8674506665_781abbb262_b" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2770" height="440" src="http&#58;//www.sinnerschrader.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/8674506665_781abbb262_b.jpg" width="500"/></p></div>
