title: Haasenstein launches consumer portal for Dole
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><strong>Customers can track fruit from the plantation to the supermarket</strong></p><p>Dole has decided to rely even more on information and transparency from now on. With its new portal <a href="http&#58;//dole-earth.com">dole-earth.com</a>, the world's largest producer of bananas invites consumers onto its plantations.</p><p>In future Dole bananas will carry a farm code. By entering this code, customers can learn all about the fruit&#58; what banana plantation it was grown on and the route it took afterwards.</p><p>The Hamburg creative agency Haasenstein was responsible for the concept and design.</p><p><a href="http&#58;//dole-earth.com"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-798" height="445" src="http&#58;//www.sinnerschrader.com/files/2012/05/dole3-648.png" width="648"/></a></p><p>By launching <a href="http&#58;//dole-earth.com">dole-earth.com</a>, Dole is responding to growing consumer interest in the origins and production chain of their food. The website gives customers information about quality control, production methods and packaging. Interested consumers can also take a virtual tour of a plantation and meet some of Dole's staff. The portal is embedded in the completely redesigned corporate site <a href="http&#58;//www.dole.de">dole.de</a>. The Hamburg online agency spot-media handled the technical implementation.</p><p>Xavier Roussell, Head of Marketing and Communications for Dole Europe&#58;<br/>“With Dole Earth, we set new standards by presenting the growing, distribution and marketing of our fruit in an absolutely transparent way. As the leading brand in fruit, we tell the history of our products and show customers the value of the fruit. We show how a lot of know-how and dedication is required to grow crops responsibly and to supply the market every week with the highest quality fruit.”</p><p><strong>About Haasenstein</strong><br/>Digitisation has changed the market so much that companies need a new form of communication. The creative agency Haasenstein is the answer to this challenge. Their motto is&#58; ‘digital first, analogue next.’ Haasenstein (founded 2011) is the youngest member of the SinnerSchrader Group.</p></div>
