In cooperation with our partners, we have succeeded in doing this with the new brand Unzer. We will work efficiently at the interface between mobility and technology and link digital offerings with new kinds of experiences that our customers need".<br/><br/>Vincent Schmidlin, Chairman and Managing Director of the Serviceplan agencies, added&#58; “A consistent and convincing customer experience from strategy, through design and communication to product is a crucial competitive factor – especially for a service and a brand relaunch.
