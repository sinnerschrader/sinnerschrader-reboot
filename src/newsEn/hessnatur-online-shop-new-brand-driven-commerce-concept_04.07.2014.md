content: <div class="newsbody"><p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-2b7fece8-006a-e5e9-8a7c-da05656054a3"><a href="http&#58;//www.hessnatur.de">www.hessnatur.de</a></p><p>Commerce Plus helps Hessnatur, a label for sustainable fashion and lifestyle, expand their online business by providing a new store concept and re-design of their e-commerce platform hessnatur.de. The creative concept is based on brand-oriented e-commerce. It pairs contemporary product presentation and storytelling to create a unique and consistent customer experience. Hessnatur is following a current trend by combining the once separate areas of brand communication and web shop into one platform to optimally address their customers.</p><p><strong>Philipp Spangenberg, Managing Director of E-Commerce &amp; Operations at Hessnatur comments&#58;</strong></p><p>"Expanding our online business is essential to our corporate development. Commerce Plus has created a compelling and emotive store concept and design which matches all our company’s values&#58; A new online presence which incorporates ecological, social, authentic and pioneering elements. This re-design has us now well equipped for the future."</p><p>Hessnatur grossed some 70 million euros in 2011/2012, nearly 50 percent of the revenue came from their web shop. The aim of the re-launch was to create a best-in-class online shop in the segment of sustainable fashion and eco-lifestyle, representing Hessnatur’s USP in the digital world. Humanity in fashion. Online shop visitors will find detailed information on the origin and manufacturing of Hessnatur’s products presented with an emotive design. Social and environmental projects in Asia and Africa are presented extensively demonstrating the motto "content is king". The new web shop is responsive and implements subtle parallax scrolling.</p></div>
