title: Integrated Campaign for TUIfly.com
content: <div class="newsbody"><p>The air travel portal <a href="http&#58;//TUIfly.com">TUIfly.com</a> launches into the main booking period of the year with an integrated advertising campaign – produced by the Hamburg <a href="http&#58;//haasenstein.com/">creative agency Haasenstein</a>.</p><p>A TUIfly.com flight expert serves as the campaign’s key visual and communicative element. He guides customers both in communications (online and offline) and on the e-commerce platform. The figure was cast as a flight expert to demonstrate the flight portal’s strengths and benefits in an emotive way. This will serve to further strengthen the brand’s transformation from an airline into a flight booking portal in consumers’ perception, e.g. with the motifs ‘Mischen possible’ (Mixing Possible inspired by Mission Impossible), ‘Flieg niemals nie’ (Never Fly Never / Never Say Never) and “Den Preis, den er liebte” (The Price That Loved Me /The Spy Who Loved Me)</p><p>Haasenstein jointly realised the execution of the campaign with its parent company, the digital agency SinnerSchrader, which handled the integration of the campaign into the platform.<br/>This is the first time TUIfly.com has used such a tightly integrated campaign involving banners, traditional media, its online platform and newsletters, all synchronised thematically across all media for each campaign period.</p><p>The campaign will run on all relevant websites. Print ads will be served in the Bild am Sonntag. Campaigns are also planned in other traditional online/offline media (CLPs, airports, social media, events, etc.)</p><p>Timm Hanebeck, Creative Director&#58; “By using the flight expert, we have succeeded in creating a campaign element that can be made to work across all media.”</p><p><strong>About Haasenstein</strong><br/>Digitisation has changed the market so much that companies need a new form of communication. The creative agency Haasenstein is the answer to this challenge. Their motto is&#58; ‘digital first, analogue next.’ Haasenstein (founded 2011) is the youngest member of the SinnerSchrader Group.</p></div>
