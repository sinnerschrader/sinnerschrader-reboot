title: A heart for developers
content: <div class="newsbody"><p>Julia Mangold is a Product Owner. We asked her about the functions and daily tasks of this job. And now we know that Julia cares about the IT world, loves cars and that Tough Mudder was a good challenge for her... but read for yourself... </p><p><strong>Generally speaking, what does your working day look like as a product owner?</strong><br/>As a product owner, I am basically the voice that communicates between the agency and the customer. I deliberately bring different stakeholders together, take information into a company and bring it back to the agency, and from that I create the specifications and tasks for the respective teams. Whatever I’m doing, I always stay focused on the product vision we are working on together. This product vision with a clear target is strategically devised, coordinated and stipulated in advance by SinnerSchrader. <br/>On a day-to- day basis, I also create and maintain the backlog, formulate the user stories and prioritise them. All this is done flexibly using Scrum. There are regular sprint meetings to decide what needs to be done and when, and I make sure that everyone in the team understands what has to be done. <br/>I maintain very close contact with the client – I’m there once or twice a week and take part in jour fixes and customer workshops to present the product and the state of affairs, among other things, on a regular basis. One of my most important jobs is the management of all stakeholders – from service providers to internal departments.</p><p><strong>In your opinion, what does a product owner have to be especially good at?</strong><br/>Keeping an eye on the big picture!</p><p><strong>How did you come to have this job at SinnerSchrader?</strong><br/>I’ve worked as a project manager in the IT department since university, so I understand the IT world very well and have a heart for developers. I can put myself in their place, which is extremely important for this job and helps with some of the trickier work. <br/>Because even if I haven’t had any IT training – I studied clothing technology – I can rely on the necessary skills I have acquired thanks to my background working in IT. Quite apart from that, the title of my thesis was “A Competition Analysis of Online Shops”! I came to SinnerSchrader through a colleague. Good people get good people &#58;-)</p><p><strong>What do you like most about SinnerSchrader?</strong><br/>SinnerSchrader is the first company where I’ve felt integrated from day one thanks to the friendliness of my co-workers. Everyone here is very willing to help and everyone gets the support they need. And I was allowed to take on a lot of responsibility straight away, that’s important to me! I also like the premises, that’s a factor for me as well.</p><p><strong>How do you stay up to date for your job?</strong><br/>Luckily, as a product owner I work for a client in the automotive industry, which fits perfectly with my love of cars. I love driving, I’m interested in all types of cars and so I also love all the news, features and events, like the IAA... I regularly look at competitors’ websites and have a good sense of the new features and developments on the market. </p><p><strong>In your opinion, what are the basic requirements for a job as a product owner?</strong><br/>You have to be communicative – both within the team and with stakeholders. And conviction and motivation are very important as well – you have to be “desperate” to see feature XY implemented. Information systems is a good course to study for this job, because on the one hand it covers the business aspects of how to implement a product effectively, while on the other it also covers computer science. But as my example shows, you can cross over from different fields as well!</p><p><strong>And what do you do when you’re not at work?</strong><br/>I do a lot of sports, that’s my biggest passion. Tennis and CrossFit let me clear my mind. Taking part in Tough Mudder was a great sporting challenge – and it’s like the job, because you have a goal that you want to achieve and a team you can depend on... I’m also interested in fashion, art and architecture.</p><p><a class="news-backlink" href="/en/"><svg class="svg-ico svg-ico--arrow-left"><use xlink&#58;href="#arrow-down"></use></svg>Back to the overview</a></p></div>
