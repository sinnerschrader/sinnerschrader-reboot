title: It’s crucial you exhibit courage and curiosity for new things
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><strong>Running strategy</strong><br/><br/>Kim Köhler (Senior Strategist) outlines some parallels between her role as Community Captain Running outside work and as a Senior Strategist within SinnerSchrader.<br/>Two evenings of my week are blocked for running. Not for my own personal training, but instead, alongside approximately 50 runners as we traverse the streets of Hamburg, improving our performance while strengthening bonds (Since Corona obviously with distancing, in smaller sub groups and following all city regulations).</p><p><strong>When did you become a Community Captain? </strong><br/><br/>In early 2019 I took on the role of Community Captain in a global running community, in addition to my full-time position as a Strategist at SinnerSchrader. In both roles, I’m constantly challenging myself and fellow teammates, implementing my skills gained from the two positions in order to create a strong and positive impact through my professional and personal development.</p><p><strong>What skills are needed in your roles?</strong><br/><br/>Believe it or not, my role as a Community Captain requires some of the same skills needed in my role as a Strategist. For example, setting goals, creating schedules, training plans, and events for a diverse audience while managing so many different people at the same time, I have learned a lot about motivation and its importance both at work and as a Community Captain. Meanwhile, my own personal authenticity has proven essential in convincing others to step out of their comfort zone. Through all of this, I am discovering new ways to facilitate collaborative work and more creative approaches for trying new things. <br/><br/>In addition to learning about what it means to be a Captain of a running community, I’ve grown personally. I’m now much more relaxed about standing in front of a bunch of runners or important decision-makers, and my learnings have made it much easier for me to organize myself in projects and workshops. In fact, our project structures are also similar to training schedules—you need different incentives to stay motivated in order to achieve effective results&#58; Sprints, consistent involvement, clear targets, long-term engagement, and performance reviews can be key.</p><p><strong>What does your work as a Strategist look like in detail?</strong><br/><br/>First of all, at SinnerSchrader I’ve the chance to work on various clients and with many different combinations of team members and skill-sets, which is awesome as it never gets monotonous and I love working with people - as you can imagine.<br/><br/>When it comes to project content I’ve developed several digital product, service and portfolio strategies for our clients. We always start with a human focus and work back to the technology from there. Whether that’s defining new opportunity fields, innovating new products or refining existing solutions. As strategists, we have to both consider and/or define the big picture visions, business goals, and requirements of digital ecosystems right through to pragmatic quick-wins and immediate outcomes. On service design projects I’m working closely together with colleagues from product design, product engineering and business advisory. What is really special about our work is the integration of real human needs through detailed user research. For optimal results, we as strategists are involved in user in-depth interviews, use labs or ethnographic research. In addition to that, we are also responsible for helping to shape impactful presentation storylines as well as working with cross-discipline teams in the development across all chapters and topics. Additionally, I’m responsible for designing and facilitating workshops including for an internal training series, called “Campus events” where I coach employees on the Product Field methodology for their project work.</p><p><strong>Are there any further parallels in your work and race strategies?</strong><br/><br/>Yes, definitely. When I’m thinking about the comparison of pitches and race preparations, the word intensity comes to my mind. For both situations you have to work hard to achieve the optimal result. But the processes of getting to that end result do vary. In a pitch phase you are working intensely with all kinds of disciplines, going back and forth, sometimes eating unhealthy food, and getting less rest than normal. (Although, overtime at SinnerSchrader is very rare.) In the optimal race preparation process, you are training both in a group and on your own, getting input from different experts from time to time, but definitely eating healthy, and valuing your recovery time for rest and recouping before the big race. There is however one more similarity both processes share&#58; the relief and joy that comes after you cross the metaphorical or literal finish line.</p><p><strong>How do you manage to keep your pace?</strong><br/><br/>In balancing both roles effectively, I’ve learnt to develop a strong mindset and remain disciplined in order to handle all of my tasks, appointments, and goals—all while leaving time for my private life. Last summer was a time in which this was made abundantly clear, whilst trying to manage both. It all became a bit too much and so I began to be more mindful and started meditating and learning how to live with many topics on my plate. I’m still learning a lot, but at the moment, I’m thankful for all experiences and feedback. The great thing about SinnerSchrader is that you are never alone. I truly enjoy being involved in the transformations of runners and businesses. In their driving open discussions and honesty, I’m gaining deeper connections, avoiding more conflict, and in turn, using sport to manage stress.</p><p><strong>What’s your key to success?</strong><br/><br/>The most important thing I’ve recognized for success both in business and running is empathy. It’s very interesting to experience how people act when they meet for the first time and how they change over a period after mutual trust evolves. It’s also crucial you exhibit courage and curiosity for new things. You have to be hungry for change. What’s more, flexible, when it comes to unfamiliar topics and situations is vital.<br/>Most of all, being 100% a team player. This is what’s influenced me most in choosing SinnerSchrader and my running community—the people and culture are very special within both.</p><p>Kim is a Senior Strategist, and started at SinnerSchrader in January 2018. She has worked for different client accounts within industry sectors like Automotive &amp; Mobility, Hospitality &amp; Tourism, Retail &amp; Consumer Goods, Media &amp; Telecommunication and Sports.</p></div>
