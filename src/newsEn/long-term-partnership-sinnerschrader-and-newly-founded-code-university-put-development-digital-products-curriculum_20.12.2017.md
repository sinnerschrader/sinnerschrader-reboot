title: Long-term partnership&#58; SinnerSchrader and the newly founded CODE University put the development of digital products on the curriculum
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><strong>Hamburg, December 2017</strong> –  In Silicon Valley, the digital products of the future are invented, whereas in Germany they are just copied. This is a common preconception. But a profession for digital products has developed at start-ups and innovative agencies in Germany, too, in recent years and is on an equal international footing. Demand for talent of this kind is exploding.</p><p>In order to fill this gap, CODE University in Berlin – a unique institution in Germany – is now being launched with a central focus on digital product development. The learning concept is aimed at enabling software developers, designers and product managers to develop the next generation of digital products. </p><p>Alongside companies such as Facebook, Xing and Zalando, SinnerSchrader is the only service provider among the founding partners. SinnerSchrader will be actively involved in the newly founded university with digital expertise, interdisciplinary teams, guest lectures and real customer projects. The wide-ranging partnership also includes a significant six-figure financial commitment for the years ahead.</p><p>Matthias Schrader (founder and CEO of SinnerSchrader) comments on the partnership&#58; “We plan to hire several hundred product developers, designers and managers over the next three years. The partnership with CODE University is an exciting platform for us to advance our shared topic of digital product development. With our book on “transformational products”, we ourselves published one of the standard works on the topic this year. I am confident that our partnership can offer added value for the students at CODE in particular.”</p><p>Manuel Dolderer (co-founder and president of CODE) adds&#58; <br/>“We are delighted to have gained SinnerSchrader as a partner for CODE that recognised at a very early stage that successful digital products can only be created by combining the three elements of software development, design and product management. Developing digital products together with the employees of SinnerSchrader and benefiting from their wide-ranging experience is a fantastic opportunity for the students at CODE. We are very much looking forward to working together.”</p><p><a class="news-backlink" href="/en/"><svg class="svg-ico svg-ico--arrow-left"><use xlink&#58;href="#arrow-down"></use></svg>Back to the overview</a></p></div>
