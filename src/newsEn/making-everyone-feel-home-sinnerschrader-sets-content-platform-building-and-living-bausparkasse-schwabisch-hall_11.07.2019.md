title: Making everyone feel at home – SinnerSchrader sets up a content platform on building and living for Bausparkasse Schwäbisch Hall
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><strong>Hamburg, July 2019 </strong>– On behalf of Bausparkasse Schwäbisch Hall AG, SinnerSchrader is launching the content platform wohnglueck.de, which provides relevant content and services relating to building, modernisation and living. Articles are published daily with the aim of entertaining, inspiring and advising platform users on the respective topics. Useful tools integrated in the content environment deliver tangible added value for users. For instance, suitable offers from a Germany-wide pool of providers can be selected via the prefabricated-housing database.  </p><p>SinnerSchrader is responsible for the relaunch and the simultaneous repositioning of the “Wohnglück” brand. This entails technical and content-related design of the portal wohnglueck.de in conjunction with Bausparkasse Schwäbisch Hall, and taking care of all social-media channels. Article content is jointly prepared by SinnerSchrader and Hamburg-based agency Planet c.</p><p>The platform was set up using Paperboy, developed in-house by SinnerSchrader. Compared with a conventional content-management system, the Paperboy architecture focuses on efficient and effective cross-channel content marketing. The standard editing system is optimised for fast and simple content creation, and helpful tools such as “Searchmetrics” and “Yoast!” are directly integrated for data-driven editing. Paperboy lays all the technical foundations for creating powerful, scalable and secure websites. Content is available for various use scenarios (websites, RSS, Alexa or apps).</p><p>“Our content is geared towards personal benefit and sharing of expertise. We aim to give our users greater autonomy by providing individual decision-making aids,” says Schwäbisch Hall project manager Markus Maier, explaining the defining feature of wohnglück.de.<br/>To achieve these aims, three “guidance principles” have been developed as a peg for holistic, cross-channel content positioning&#58; Guidance at topic level through orientation towards specific user needs such as search queries, guidance at format level through a focus on informative formats, and guidance at user-navigation and feature level in order to meet individual content preferences.</p><p>“Cooperative and agile collaboration with Schwäbisch Hall and Planet c enabled us to set up the performance-oriented content site wohnglück.de really quickly. With relevant journalistic content and a rigorous focus on the user insights gained, we have created a portal that gives users genuine long-term added value on the topics of building, modernisation and living,” adds Natascha Tümmers, Executive Director at SinnerSchrader.</p><p><a class="news-backlink" href="/en/"><svg class="svg-ico svg-ico--arrow-left"><use xlink&#58;href="#arrow-down"></use></svg>Back to the overview</a></p></div>
