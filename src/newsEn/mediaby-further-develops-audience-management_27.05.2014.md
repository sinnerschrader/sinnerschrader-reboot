title: Mediaby further develops audience management
content: <div class="newsbody"><p>Mediaby, a media agency specializing in intelligent and efficient display advertising, has further developed their consulting approach for successful audience management, underscoring their claim "data-driven relationships".Their key objective was the optimal and target-driven placement of digital marketing at user-level and the efficient use of every euro invested by advertisers.</p><p>"We are aware that excellent audience management can only work in combination with well-founded consulting. Clients have to develop an understanding of what lies behind the system (ad-server, BI infrastructure, etc.), how customer journey analysis findings are interpreted and which logic lies behind certain decision-making. This is the only way to reach optimal results and attain communal understanding. For this reason, we have re-defined our method," explains Karin Libowitzky, Managing Director at Mediaby.</p><p>For successful audience management, Mediaby addresses four key issues in close cooperation with their clients and with the aid of customer journey analysis findings&#58; Sending the right message (what), at the right time (when) in the right place (where) and addressing the right person (who). It is therefore of importance that the correct user segment be identified as well as a contact route with the highest possible conversion potential (highest purchasing potential) and that all coherences be translated into intelligent placement logic. Efficiency also means that the purchasing process is easily accessible with a minimum of possible contact points. The objectives of the audience management will always be compiled and defined in close communication with the advertisers.</p><p><strong>Audience Management at Mediaby</strong><br/>At the forefront of audience management is the collection of sufficient data. Another deciding factor is meaningful data processing. Mediaby offers clients an individual approach with their in-house business intelligence team, who are responsible for comprehensive data collection, customer journey analysis, segmenting within audience types and the technical placement of marketing within the customer segments. The client’s individual needs play a vital role during the entire process. Which objectives underlie the proposed marketing campaign? The results of the customer journey analysis will be discussed and compared with the campaign’s objectives. This facilitates the integration into the high-end ad-server system, which is able to produce intelligent coherences between audience segments with defined placement logic. For this, Mediaby relies on the technology of fellow subsidiary Next Audience.</p><p><strong>Marketing Operating System</strong><br/>Mediaby employs their established marketing operating system so that clients may track the development of their campaign and react quickly. A dashboard displays all available onsite and offsite data in aggregated form and the most interesting KPIs and may be used as a real-time tool for audience management optimization and evaluation. The dashboard offers maximum transparency, allowing clients a better understanding of coherences and allows for campaign planning and management in real-time, internationally, nationally and regionally. The process for effective audience management is re-started at regular intervals in order to monitor the campaign objectives, the audience segments and the resulting placement logic and amend them if need be.</p><p>This marketing dashboard is currently in use for Stage Entertainment in Germany.</p><p><strong>Downloads&#58;</strong><br/><a href="https://next-audience.com/media/filer_public/8f/3c/8f3c1497-49aa-46d6-a767-91d39e173d92/mediaby_dashboard_screen_management-summary.png" target="_blank">Dashboard Dummy Summary</a><br/><a href="https://next-audience.com/media/filer_public/30/f6/30f6e264-e61c-4111-942d-b923857fa995/mediaby_dashboard_screen_ebene-2-detailansicht.png" target="_blank">Dashboard Dummy Detailansicht1</a><br/><a href="https://next-audience.com/media/filer_public/f7/c1/f7c1d75e-1dcf-4244-87e5-28e13a017133/mediaby_dashboard_ebene-3-detailansicht.png" target="_blank">Dashboard Dummy Detailansicht2</a><br/><a href="https://next-audience.com/media/filer_public/93/61/93611d20-053d-40a0-b8e8-23929c58c99b/karin-libowitzky.jpg" target="_blank">Foto Karin Libowitzky, Managing Director (300dpi)</a></p><p></p></div>
