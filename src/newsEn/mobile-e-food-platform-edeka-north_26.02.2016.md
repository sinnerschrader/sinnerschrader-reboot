title: SinnerSchrader Commerce realises mobile e-food platform for EDEKA North
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><a href="https://www.edekanord-shop.de/" target="_blank">edekanord-shop.de/</a></p><p>EDEKA North has developed a new, decentralised e-commerce concept that has now been brought to life by SinnerSchrader Commerce. This sales concept is a white label solution for all retailers in the Group.</p><p>EDEKA loves food and has a resolute passion for its customers. Extraordinary campaigns and new distribution channels are constantly emerging from EDEKA headquarters to surprise the market. Now EDEKA North is making a fresh attempt to enter the e-food commerce sector, setting up a pilot online shop with the help of SinnerSchrader Commerce. Retailers can request that their various product ranges be entered into the system at the prices set for their specific region. Around 13,000 items are available online, including fresh and self-service products. The supermarkets themselves handle the logistics regionally. Customers can choose the approximate time of delivery or collect their shopping from the store. This model is intended as a blueprint for all Edeka supermarkets in the northern region. Five members of the Group are already on-board for the pilot. More are due to follow shortly.</p><p>The e-food platform is part of EDEKA's overarching sales strategy. So it makes sense that the online shop closely resembles edeka.de at first glance. But the devil is in the detail, and consumers notice the innovation as soon as they start shopping. Achieving that delicate balance between a familiar shopping experience and innovative new features is key for this new distribution channel, which Commerce Plus realised with its razor-sharp instinct for customers' needs.</p><p>In addition, a mobile version was tested for smartphones that primarily focuses on credit purchases and appeals to the mobile buyer. It is geared to the needs of consumers on the move, whilst the tablet and desktop version impresses with additional content.</p><p>SinnerSchrader Commerce was responsible for strategic consulting, concept development, design, project management and quality assurance. Software development fell to diva-e.</p><p>The intention is to gradually expand the shop and adapt it to customers' usage behaviour. The challenge is to offer innovations that are actually useful, which are both learned yet still classed as innovative.</p><h2>Downloads</h2><p><a href="https://commerce-plus.com/media/filer_public/fb/c3/fbc31954-9904-406a-8379-ef40720577ef/edekanord_homepage_boecker.jpg" target="_blank">screenshot Website EDEKA Böcker/ Hafencity Hamburg</a></p><p><a href="https://commerce-plus.com/media/filer_public/86/60/8660aeac-dfe5-48e8-8052-0c8ef34f7d99/commerceplus_boecker_edeka_nord.jpg" target="_blank">motive delivery van EDEKA Böcker/ Hafencity Hamburg</a></p><a class="filer_image_link" href="https://www.edekanord-shop.de" target="_blank"><img alt="EDEKANord_Homepage_Boecker.jpg" class="filer_image" src="/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/fb/c3/fbc31954-9904-406a-8379-ef40720577ef/edekanord_homepage_boecker.jpg__1028x929_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.jpg" srcset="/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/fb/c3/fbc31954-9904-406a-8379-ef40720577ef/edekanord_homepage_boecker.jpg__298x179_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.jpg 480w, /media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/fb/c3/fbc31954-9904-406a-8379-ef40720577ef/edekanord_homepage_boecker.jpg__1028x929_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.jpg 481w"/></a><h2></h2><h2>About Commerce Plus</h2><p>Commerce Plus is an e-commerce specialist agency and part of the SinnerSchrader Group.
