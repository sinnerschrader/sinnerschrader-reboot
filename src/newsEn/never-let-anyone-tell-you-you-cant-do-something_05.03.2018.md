title: Never let anyone tell you that you can’t do something
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><strong>Felicitas Kugland (31)<br/>Principal Engineer, Developer Relations</strong></p><p><strong>What do you do at SinnerSchrader?</strong><br/>On the one hand, I do a lot of community work at SinnerSchrader and, for example, I come up with new formats that can be implemented in addition to hackathons or meetings. I can also do part of my work as a curator for the JSConf EU and I am active as a team member for the CSSconf EU. I also work on a wide range of customer projects so that I don’t just become a theoretician. After all, this is the only way to find out how things actually work in implementation and to experience the struggles that a developer sometimes has. With all of this, no two days are ever the same for me and I don’t have a regular daily routine in my job.</p><p><strong>Which topic and which tool is currently the highlight for you?</strong><br/>Open source is my favourite topic at the moment. I am tidying up our SinnerSchrader open-source projects to make them more contributor-friendly and then publicise them more so that SinnerSchrader’s open-source software can become better known.<br/>My absolute favourite tool right now is Alva (digital design tool, https://meetalva.io/), which we have just developed, and an all-time favourite of mine is Patternplate (<a href="https://github.com/sinnerschrader/patternplate" target="_blank">https://github.com/sinnerschrader/patternplate</a>).</p><p><strong>What is more important, the job title, the salary or the work?</strong><br/>The work is definitely the most important thing for me! I am lucky enough to have a job I really enjoy. I like developing in my free time as well.<br/>And I want to have an impact, I want my work to make a difference and help my colleagues and the agency. Job titles aren’t important to me, because I have often noticed that a title can be just empty words, while on the other hand some people don’t have a title but are just so good at what they do.</p><p><strong>What can people learn from the world’s top developers?</strong><br/>For every developer you ask, there are other very good developers who each have their own viewpoint. The ones who are important to me are people from whom you can not only learn to develop better and progress in terms of your job, but can also learn very general things... For example, how to work better in a team or - a very important aspect - to pay attention to self-care!<br/>I used to have gurus and role models in and from the community. And then eventually when I met this or that developer I realised that they are all normal people who aren’t better at everything than me. Since then, I don’t have any role models any more. Instead, I take what I need for a job or how I want to be personally from a lot of different people. That is actually very liberating.</p><p><strong>What is the most important prerequisite for a good developer?</strong><br/>The most important thing is to be motivated and to put your motivation into practice. You should always keep developing and should value and enjoy continuous learning. You should be able to see the bigger picture and it is also essential to be willing to compromise.<br/>I always tell everyone&#58; never let anyone tell you that you can’t do something. You can learn anything if you want to and are willing to invest in it. Your age and your previous education etc. don’t matter.</p><p><strong>How can you keep up to date with the latest developments?</strong><br/>It has become established to be on Twitter and follow the relevant people there.  Read specialist articles, topics and discussions and communicate via the tools you use. Subscribe to newsletters from all areas, such as CSS weekly, JS weekly...<br/>It also helps to look around different blogs, read Medium and go to meet-ups and relevant conferences.<br/>And of course exchange experiences within the company!</p><p><strong>What about remote work?</strong><br/>If you know each other well and have already worked together successfully on a project, the connection and trust are there and remote work can then be satisfying, too.<br/>Remote work is not always easy, because a lot of information is shared in conversations with colleagues in the same room. You can take a quick look at a monitor together and solve an issue as a group, and it is simply more communicative to be with the team on site.</p><p><strong>What else do you need to stay happy?</strong><br/>Pasta!! &#58;-)</p></div>
