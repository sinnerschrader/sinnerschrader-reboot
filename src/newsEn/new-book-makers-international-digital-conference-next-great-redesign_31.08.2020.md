title: New book from the makers of the international digital conference NEXT&#58; The Great Redesign
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><strong><em>The Great Redesign – Frameworks</em> for the Future – this is the title of the new book from digital pioneer Matthias Schrader and communication expert Volker Martens. Due to COVID-19, it is appearing without a physical conference but nonetheless with renowned speakers such as Azeem Azhar, Benedict Evans, Miriam Meckel, David Mattin, Genevieve Bell and Ramez Naam.</strong></p><p>Hamburg, 01 September 2020 – Times of crisis pose a radical challenge to our normality. After all, what has led us into a crisis will not lead us back out again. The lockdown and reset will therefore be followed by a redesign of our world. </p><p>Ideas for this are gathered in the book The Great Redesign (to be published on 20 October) with essays from international thought leaders in digital transformation. There are contributions from authors including Azeem Azhar, David Mattin, Genevieve Bell, Benedict Evans, Ramez Naam and Miriam Meckel, whose newsletters and books are held in high regard by a broad expert audience. As analysts, scientists, designers or trend researchers, they analyse and comment on the current situation and share ideas for a world that needs new and inspiring thoughts in light of the pandemic. </p><p>In 17 essays, the authors outline the design possibilities that the current global crisis is creating for the future. They examine the topic of The Great Redesign from a wide variety of perspectives ranging from work and global value chains, to politics and capital, future design and innovation, the transformation of our cities and our energy supply, diversity and language, art and cybernetics. The authors from the USA, Asia and Europe provide facts and frameworks for designing our future.</p><p>The book is being published by Next Factory Ottensen and is edited by the major agency thinkers Matthias Schrader (Accenture Interactive) and Volker Martens (FAKTOR 3).
