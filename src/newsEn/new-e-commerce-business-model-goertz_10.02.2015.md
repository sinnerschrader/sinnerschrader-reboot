title: SinnerSchrader Commerce develops new e-commerce business model for Görtz
content: <div class="newsbody"><p>In cooperation with SinnerSchrader Commerce, shoe retailer Görtz is planning the comprehensive expansion of their e-commerce and multi-channel business. The Hamburg-based e-commerce agency is responsible for the concept development and implementation of the new digital business model. The Görtz project is one of the largest single contracts so far for SinnerSchrader Commerce.</p><h3>Moritz Koch, Managing Director at SinnerSchrader Commerce&#58;</h3><p><em>"Our collaboration with Görtz demonstrates how important the careful integration of digital sales concepts has become to retailers, to boost online and offline business. We are compelled by this exciting task and are looking very forward to go live. "</em></p><p>During the project’s preparatory phase, SinnerSchrader Commerce created a tailored business model which encompasses a sourcing strategy. The strategy provides in-sourcing options, as well as a selection of dedicated external partners to cover specific service areas. The initial project is planned to go live this year. Görtz will benefit from SinnerSchrader Commerce’ experience in strategic development, technical implementation and concept development as well as the implementation of back-end systems and processes later on.</p><p><a href="https://commerce-plus.com/media/filer_public/b2/cf/b2cfa9ef-205f-479d-9389-01a22e9a3efa/goertz_filiale_frankfurt.jpg" target="_blank">Download press photo (Flagshipstore Frankfurt. ©Görtz)</a></p><p><a class="news-backlink" href="/en/"><svg class="svg-ico svg-ico--arrow-left"><use xlink&#58;href="#arrow-down"></use></svg>Back to the overview</a></p></div>
