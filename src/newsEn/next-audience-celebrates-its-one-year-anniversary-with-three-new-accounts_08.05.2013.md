The 100% subsidiary of the SinnerSchrader AG was founded during the NEXT Berlin in early May 2012 as a technology provider for online advertisers.</p><p>Crucial to the advertisers’ decision to go with NEXT AUDIENCE were their cross-publisher and cross-channel analysis and delivery features based on a state-of-the-art adserver, but more notably the prospect of gaining complete control over their own data.</p><p><strong>Friendscout24 values cross-publisher and cross-channel analysis and delivery features </strong></p><p>Jens L. Bunger, Vice President of Online Marketing &amp; International Business at Friendscout24, Germany's leading partner site with six additional European sites, comments, "we have chosen Next Audience’s technology because it offers the most comprehensive gauging and analysis of campaign success – independent of publishers and advertising channels. With this, we can ensure the efficient use of digital marketing budgets and, by using our own data, make new features available. In this respect, dynamic, profile-based advertising can be created and delivered at ease."</p><p><strong>BASE takes interest in increasing cross-brand efficiency </strong></p><p>With its 24 million customers, the E-Plus Group is Germany’s third largest mobile provider. Their brand BASE will be the first to use the Next Audience Platform in order to attain relevant coverage and to more efficiently book advertising media. Jürgen Rösger, CMO of the E-Plus Group, remarks, "we are interested in increasing efficiency across all brands and in the delivery of our media planning. We expect to gain best practices and insights with the Next Audience Tool, which we plan to apply to our other brands. It is important to have a consistent framework and to enable constructive collaboration with our media agencies."</p><p><strong>norisbank makes use of state-of-the-art adserver technology with extensive customer journey analysis </strong></p><p>Thomas große Darrelmann, Chief Representative of norisbank, an online bank of the Deutsche Bank Group, comments, "we feel strongly that we will make significant progress in optimizing the efficiency and effectiveness of our marketing and sales through customer journey analysis. In particular, the agency independent and cross-channel advertising analysis, which has been set up with Next Audience’s technology, promises new and beneficial insight for continuing optimization measures along the sales funnel. For example, valuable information on overlapping, which we intend to use for improved delivery across digital advertising channels."</p><p>Torsten Ahlers, CEO at Next Audience, adds, "I am delighted that just shy of our one year anniversary, we have been able to acquire such notable clients for our advertising technology. By choosing Next Audience, our clients have proven that our strategic position of multi-publisher and multi-agency audience management for online advertisers was on the mark. Advertisers increasingly want control over their own data and to determine its use in data-driven online marketing. Without a doubt, we are the most suitable partner."</p><p><strong>About NEXT AUDIENCE </strong></p><p>The NEXT AUDIENCE GmbH is a 100% subsidiary of SinnerSchrader AG and is located in Hamburg.
