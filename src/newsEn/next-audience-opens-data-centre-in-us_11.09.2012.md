title: NEXT AUDIENCE opens data centre in US
content: <div class="newsbody"><p>SinnerSchrader subsidiary provides advertisers with infrastructure for North and South America</p><p>As Germany’s leading technology provider for data-driven online marketing and audience management, NEXT AUDIENCE has now gone live with its own data centre for markets in North and South America. Adservers, database servers, and front-end servers are now available at the site in Miami/Florida site, which will open the door for German advertisers’ online market entry from Canada to Argentina.<br/>Torsten Ahlers, CEO of NEXT AUDIENCE, explains the reasons for the expansion&#58; "More and more advertisers from Germany want to grow internationally – including overseas. In addition to strong markets like the US and Canada, emerging markets such as Argentina and Brazil in particular are developing into very lucrative regions. With our data centre in Miami we are now able to analyse online user data for North and South America as well, define target groups and deliver appropriate information to potential buyers in real-time."<br/>NEXT AUDIENCE’s first customer to use the targeting adserver controlled from Miami is Bigpoint. The games of the world's leading online games developer are played by over 200 million users in more than 30 languages.</p><p>Bigpoint CFO Michael Gutsmann is very pleased with the initial results of the collaboration&#58; "We were highly impressed with the tests for Canada, the USA and Mexico. Our goal – a campaign uplift of 30 percent - was already exceeded in the test rounds. The speed and accuracy of the data evaluation and the delivery of information to game enthusiasts have exceeded our expectations. In particular, we would never have achieved such short lag times with server architecture based in Germany."</p><p>Dirk Klose, CTO of NEXT AUDIENCE, is proud of the new offer&#58; "In less than three months we have built a complete, fully functional server infrastructure for the entire North and South American continent. The successful tests with Bigpoint, and the great interest of many German advertisers in using our US data centre confirm that making the move across the pond was a good idea."<br/>NEXT AUDIENCE will be providing visitors with detailed information about its Americas data centre at dmexco 2012 from 12 to 13 September.</p><p>Photos are posted in the download section at <a href="http&#58;//www.next-audience.com/presse/" title="next-audience.com/presse/">http&#58;//www.next-audience.com/presse/</a></p><p><a class="news-backlink" href="/en/"><svg class="svg-ico svg-ico--arrow-left"><use xlink&#58;href="#arrow-down"></use></svg>Back to the overview</a></p></div>
