title: NEXT AUDIENCE wins Bigpoint
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><strong>World’s biggest browser games portal now uses new NEXT AUDIENCE ad-serving and targeting technology</strong></p><p>Shortly after changing its name from newtention to NEXT AUDIENCE, the Hamburg-based company has already won one of the largest providers of online games as a new customer. Bigpoint now uses NEXT AUDIENCE’s new targeting and ad-server technology. Bigpoint is a developer of online games, and a publisher and content provider for around 1,000 international distribution partners. Its games are played by over 200 million players in more than 30 languages.</p><p>With the system provided by NEXT AUDIENCE, Bigpoint can accurately model user segments to be targeted with the integrated ad management solution, with almost no scatter losses.</p><p>The technology combines state-of-the-art, in-memory database technology, persistent cookies, and a scalable real-time targeting engine that can process several 100,000 requests per second.</p><p>A decisive factor in the decision to use the NEXT AUDIENCE technology was the company’s international focus. Bigpoint CFO Michael Gutsmann comments&#58; "We plan to continue expanding and were looking for a provider with the necessary resources and the best systems. We have found this partner in NEXT AUDIENCE."</p><p>NEXT AUDIENCE CEO Torsten Ahlers adds&#58; "As a first step we are supporting Bigpoint campaigns in Europe. From September, the browser portal will be able to access resources from our new US data centre in Miami. Especially for German companies targeting a global market, we deliver the right infrastructure, technological know-how made in Germany, and most importantly the guarantee that we can implement all campaigns in compliance with data protection regulations."</p><p>Ahlers views the cooperation with Bigpoint as an endorsement of the new corporate strategy&#58; "Bigpoint’s decision shows that our change in strategy was made at the right time. Increasingly, advertisers are taking control of their own data and audience management – and we are the perfect partner for this."</p><p><strong>About NEXT AUDIENCE</strong><br/>NEXT AUDIENCE GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hamburg-based SinnerSchrader AG, was created from the German targeting pioneer newtention technologies in May 2012.
