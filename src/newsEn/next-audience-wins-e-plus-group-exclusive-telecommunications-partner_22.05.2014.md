content: <div class="newsbody"><p><strong>NEXT AUDIENCE Unveils New Features.</strong></p><p>The E-Plus Group is increasingly using Adserver and Audience Management technology from NEXT AUDIENCE, a 100-percent subsidiary of SinnerSchrader AG, for its digital marketing.</p><p>The E-Plus Group, Germany's third largest mobile telecommunications network operator, is interested in providing its more than 25 million customers with solutions and answers to meet their needs, rather than overloading them with advertising.</p><p>NEXT AUDIENCE technology serves ads that are appropriate for the user and the point in time. The E-Plus Group is NEXT AUDIENCE’s exclusive telecommunication partner.</p><p>The new features of the NEXT AUDIENCE PLATFORM allows the E-Plus Group to use dynamic advertising materials to advertise differently to customers than to non-customers. Based on specific profile logics, the new technology serves display, affiliate and real time advertising (RTA), newsletter and website ads in a targeted way. By focusing on relevant users, it massively reduces scatter losses.</p><p>To ensure targeted ad serving, data stored on the server from earlier campaigns, from the website and from CRM data is incorporated in customer communications as profiles. User recognition and ad targeting is carried out across devices and brands.</p><p>Roland Dömges (picture), ‪Head of Paid Online Traffic at the E-Plus Group&#58; "We place particular value on significant cross-brand increases in the efficiency of media investments. Using data stored on the server and the integrated CRM data, we can identify user preferences and can use dynamic advertising materials to target them with a significantly higher hit rate than with traditional non-targeted campaigns." ‬‬‬‬‬</p><p>Torsten Ahlers, CEO of NEXT AUDIENCE, adds&#58; "Our new features and comprehensive data aggregation give advertisers a much more economical way to generate relevant traffic. Traditional non-targeted reach campaigns with their scatter losses become a thing of the past.
