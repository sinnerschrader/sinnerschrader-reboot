title: NEXT Berlin 2012 calls for participation
content: <div class="newsbody"><p>NEXT Berlin, the leading European conference for the digital economy, is once again calling on its community to actively help shape the programme. Suggestions for speakers and topics can be submitted on <a href="http&#58;//nextberlin.eu">nextberlin.eu</a> until 29 November and may be voted on until 20 December. At the end of the voting phase, the best of the top scorers will be invited to speak at NEXT Berlin on 8/9 May. At this two-day conference as part of Berlin Web Week, a Who's Who of the international digital industry will gather to discuss the digital future.</p><p><strong>Call for participation</strong><br/>Since its establishment, NEXT Berlin has focused strongly on the community and this remains the case in 2012&#58; the digital community is once again invited to submit suggestions for topics and speakers and vote for them at <a href="http&#58;//nextberlin.eu">nextberlin.eu</a>. The NEXT Berlin curators will sift through the proposals with the most votes and decide who will speak at NEXT12. In addition, there will be a stage that is exclusively dedicated to community suggestions, curated by Igor Schwarzmann. Suggestions should reflect the theme of the upcoming NEXT12 - ‘Post-Digital’.</p><p><strong>The motto ‘Post-Digital’</strong><br/>NEXT12 will again have a motto. After ‘Data Love’ was this year’s theme, in 2012 everything will revolve around ‘Post-Digital’. The digital revolution is over and digital has won. There is nothing new, or innovative any more, because we now take for granted the use of digital technologies in everyday life. The boundaries between digital and real worlds are rapidly dissolving. The time has come to explore the question of what awaits us beyond the digital revolution, in the post-digital age.</p><p><strong>The tracks and their curators</strong><br/>The programme is once again structured into six vertical thematic tracks, each curated by a distinguished industry expert&#58; ‘Technology’ by Holger Blank, ‘Fashion’, by Anitra Eggler, ‘Mobile’ by Laurent Burdin, ‘Experience’ by Peter Bihr, and ‘Creative’ by Elisabeth Stangl. The curator of ‘Start-ups’ will be announced shortly. In addition, there will once again be an overarching ‘International Keynote Track’ at NEXT12, curated by Monique van Dusseldorp as International Programme Director.</p><p>For more information about NEXT Berlin, see <a href="http&#58;//nextberlin.eu">http&#58;//nextberlin.eu</a></p><p><strong>About SinnerSchrader</strong><br/>SinnerSchrader is one of the leading digital agencies in Europe.
