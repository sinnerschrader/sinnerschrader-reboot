title: NEXT Berlin 2013 – Leading. European. Digital.
content: <div class="newsbody"><p>New date, new venue. At the trendsetting conference, to be held in Berlin on April 23 &amp; 24, economic leaders and digital pioneers will gather to exchange views and visions of our digitally revolutionised economic future.</p><p><strong>For the eighth time, the digital agency SinnerSchrader will host the conference NEXT Berlin, this time on 23 &amp; 24 April at the BCC in the heart of Berlin. NEXT Berlin has established itself in recent years as an important agenda setter for tomorrow’s topics of the digital economy in Europe. Talks and workshops held by internationally renowned experts on business trends inspire more than 2,000 participants from around the world. This time, experts will address the topics invisible technology, new interfaces, the importance of context and the makers. The central theme of next year's conference will be&#58; Here be dragons!</strong></p><p style="padding-left&#58; 60px;"><em>“Here be dragons” is a phrase used to denote dangerous or unexplored territories, in imitation of the medieval practice of putting sea serpents and other mythological creatures in uncharted areas of maps.</em></p><p>The digital revolution and the interactive consumer continue to shake up one industry after another. To survive and succeed, companies constantly need to rethink and change their business models, enter new markets or even invent them. They need to explore uncharted waters, discover new territories! And what applies for established companies, also effects start-ups; remember that Flickr was once a role playing game, and YouTube a dating site, not to mention Apple’s metamorphosis.</p><p>This is why ’Here be dragon’ is the theme of NEXT Berlin 2013. The conference will provide more than 2,000 attendees with a map for new business adventures. Which paths shall be taken? Which areas are worth exploring? And where are the new inventions and innovations taking us? Where do dangers lurk and how can we embrace new challenges? Dragons are not necessarily invincible opponents, but rather opportunities that carry great potential.</p><p>On 23 &amp; 24 April, NEXT Berlin will become Europe’s most important meeting place of the digital economy. Marketers of major brands, business strategists, international investors, established managers as well as young entrepreneurs, developers and creative minds will all exchange views and visions on our digital future.</p><p>The conference stands out due to its thematic diversity, the interdisciplinary exchange of ideas and the many inspiring talks from renowned experts and digital thought leaders with business, creative, technology, art or science backgrounds. In recent years, the number of participants has grown constantly, especially from other European countries and beyond. Due to its international character, the conference language is English.</p><p>The programme of NEXT Berlin 2013 is being curated by Peter Bihr and Monique van Dusseldorp. Again, it will look at trends likely to develop over the next 12 to 36 months. Four areas are in particular focus&#58;</p><p><strong>1. Invisible&#58; Technology gets transparent</strong><br/>It is virtually impossible to separate the digital and the non-digital world. The Internet is not just another channel to interact with people or connect with customers, it's everywhere. Everything is interconnected.</p><p><strong>2. Interface&#58; APIs, interaction and new services</strong><br/>In the post-PC era users are moving away from desktops towards lightweight devices. In 2013, the majority will go online via mobile devices. Accordingly, we’ll need to rethink human-machine interfaces and design services that the user really wants. The focus shifts from marketing and communication to product and service.</p><p><strong>3. Make(r)&#58; DIY, 3D printing and the makers</strong><br/>Everything analog goes digital. The first wave of computing digitised back-end processes and data-handling, the second communications and media, the third will digitise every possible physical object. In the same way that desktop publishing and the web democratised publishing and programming, setting free a surge of creativity, 3D printing will soon democratise innovation in the physical world of atoms.</p><p><strong>4. Context&#58; Smarter things, data and mapping</strong><br/>New portable computers in bracelets, clothing or eyewear will collect data about us and our environment that shall improve and simplify our lives. 2013 will show what innovations Google Glass will trigger. What is already possible today and where we are heading. It may sound like science fiction, but it is the new reality – and one we can shape.</p><p>All four trends are affecting the whole product chain, from hardware to software to the interface and the service layer. They require a fresh, holistic approach, a re-definition of many businesses and a customer-centric mindset. The time is right to enter unknown territories.</p><p>At NEXT Berlin innovators from around the world will present their inspiring ideas and insights. In addition to the main stage for the keynote speeches and sessions, there will be a second stage as well as workshops, where experts will enlarge upon topics such as the Internet of Things, Mobile, Technology and Service Design.</p><p>After the extraordinary success of the start-up day this year, NEXT Berlin 2013 will dedicated a whole stage to developments in the European start-up scene, this time on both conference days. This also underlines NEXT’s commitment to Berlin’s start-up scene, which has become a defining element and a relevant business driver for Germany’s capital. Start-ups will have the opportunity to pitch their business ideas to the NEXT audience; many big investors from Europe and the US will be in attendance, and may become a critical success factor for them.</p><p>NEXT Berlin invites its community to actively shape the conference programme. In late autumn speaker and topic proposals can be submitted at nextberlin.eu, which our programme curators will take into account. Further opportunities for participation, for example for start-ups, will follow.</p><p>For more information on NEXT Berlin, videos of previous conference talks and the <a href="http&#58;//nextberlin.eu">NEXT blog</a> about current digital trends go to <a href="http&#58;//nextberlin.eu">nextberlin.eu</a>.
