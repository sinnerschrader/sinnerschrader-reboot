title: NEXT Service Design 2013

Service Design as a process of development and creation of services will effect the classical product design massively. In the long term, the main focus will move from the product to the service. That is the reason why Service Design is a strategic imperative for organisations.</p><p>As a brands strategist, Nils Wollny expects three consequences of this progress. First and foremost, instead of the traditional positioning of a brand, it is important for a brand to have its place in the centre of the customer’s life. Isolated solutions will be replaced by integrated systems. And in the process of development, prototyping replaces Powerpoint. All these consequences are a result of the digital revolution. The innovation process changes dramatically - from product innovation to service innovation.</p><p><a href="http&#58;//www.sinnerschrader.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9770957882_ce2e965c83_z.jpg"><img alt="9770957882_ce2e965c83_z" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3254" height="428" src="http&#58;//www.sinnerschrader.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9770957882_ce2e965c83_z.jpg" width="640"/></a></p><p>The consequences for companies are also radical, says the American growth advisor Dean Crutchfield. Organisations have to change their way of thinking to handle this paradigm shift. In his keynote at the beginning of this year’s NEXT Service Design conference, he quoted a CEO’s pretty famous sentence&#58; “There are three way to lose money&#58; gambling, divorce and innovation.” The reason companies fear innovation is that every part of their business has to handle change. That affects strategy as well as systems and staff.</p><p><strong>High innovation pressure in the finance industry</strong></p><p>The finance industry has a very high innovation pressure. The products of their business became completely comparable and interchangeable by the use of the internet, there was little differential between them. Services and efficiency gain in importance if a unique selling point is to be created. Brian Gillespie and Lee Moreau of the American agency Continuum looked for a way for the Spanish bank BBVA to rewin the customers trust by designing individual interaction channels. Moreau und Gillespie analysed customer data to create personas, thus gaining valuable insights into their differentiated banking behaviour. Based on these results, the team at Continuum designed a platform offering very individual banking opportunities for every customer. And with their presentation at the conference they also gave a forecast what ‘the bank of the future’ will look like.</p><p>The Finnish financial service provider OP-Pohjola chose an entirely different approach when developing the mobile wallet Pivo. The officers of the project decided to implement an open platform that, on the one hand, is also open for competitors. On the other hand they created a brand that is isolated from the main business. To accomplish this, OP-Pohjola combined methods of Service Design with principles of Lean Start-up. The result is an app that is simple and easy to navigate, which helps consumers to control their spending behaviour.</p><p><a href="http&#58;//www.sinnerschrader.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9772779006_e88b9e63f6_z.jpg"><img alt="9772779006_e88b9e63f6_z" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3259" height="338" src="http&#58;//www.sinnerschrader.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9772779006_e88b9e63f6_z.jpg" width="640"/></a></p><p><strong>Mobility and travel&#58; interaction between digital interfaces and analogue hardware</strong></p><p>Other than the financial business products and services, the mobility and travel sector has a strong physical component. Service Design in this context is mainly an interaction between digital interfaces and analogue hardware. The agency IXDS, based in Berlin, developed a completely new domestic loading station for BMW electric cars. The product will be available in the last quarter of this year.</p><p>The focus of the BMWi Wallbox is on the user’s experience during the whole charging process. Currently, customers have to recharge their electric cars much more frequently than owners of traditional cars need to refill them with petrol or diesel. Additionally the loading process lasts longer compared to a fuel-based car. To accomplish transparency, BMW equipped the Wallbox with light signals to show the state of charge.</p><p>The French start-up BlaBlaCar created its idea based on the fact that more than one billion car seats remain empty on French streets every year. BlaBlaCar transferred the idea of car sharing into the digital universe. The biggest challenge was to create a web platform that brings the highest possible trust between drivers and passengers who normally don’t know each other. To achieve this ambition, BlaBlaCar created user profiles and a rating system, but also ensured financial commitment of the users and moderation of the platform. For 2013 BlaBlaCar expects ten million passengers.</p><p><a href="http&#58;//www.sinnerschrader.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9772779564_7edc660e15_z.jpg"><img alt="9772779564_7edc660e15_z" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3258" height="358" src="http&#58;//www.sinnerschrader.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9772779564_7edc660e15_z.jpg" width="640"/></a></p><p>What an odyssey a Service Design project could be was presented by Pia Betton of Edenspiekermann with a case study of ProRail, the operator of the Dutch train infrastructure. Initially, they just thought about creating posters giving directions and safety advice at the overcrowded train station in Utrecht. In the end, Edenspiekermann designed a modern and innovative train locator. In the meantime the project lacked both client and business case, but nevertheless the agency stuck to it. As of now, a first prototype has been made, a first test is completed and the rollout is on its way.</p><p><strong>Service Design accelerates product development</strong></p><p>Service Design could also play an important role in the development of a mobile app. Via prototyping and a relentless focus on the user, the Swedish agency Veryday built a Spotify app for the Windows Phone. Deutsche Telekom used methods of Service Design to answer the question what presence on a mobile phone really means. The surprising result&#58; Besides context-sensitive and filtered communication users also want ‘me-time’ which means time without any communication. Although, on the surface, this appears to be counterproductive for a telecommunications company, Telekom created an Android app for it.</p><p><a href="http&#58;//www.sinnerschrader.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/104267-2bb5b6cf-8442-49cf-b81e-1ae5e9c81c40-alexander_2520baumgardt_2520_calfornia_2520college_2520of_2520art__2520next_2520sd12-large-1374144968.jpg"><img alt="104267-2bb5b6cf-8442-49cf-b81e-1ae5e9c81c40-alexander_2520baumgardt_2520_calfornia_2520college_2520of_2520art__2520next_2520sd12-large-1374144968" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3255" height="400" src="http&#58;//www.sinnerschrader.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/104267-2bb5b6cf-8442-49cf-b81e-1ae5e9c81c40-alexander_2520baumgardt_2520_calfornia_2520college_2520of_2520art__2520next_2520sd12-large-1374144968-e1380620283709.jpg" width="600"/></a></p><p>Service Design does not slow down development processes but offers a chance to accelerate innovation and to react to customers’ wants. GE applies methods of Service Design to scale development processes across the borders of disciplines and departments inside the company. In his presentation at the conference, Alexander Baumgardt gave insights into an ongoing project. “I can’t say today how the result of it will look”, he said. But all in all the professor at the Californian College of the Arts communicated clearly how such a big project could be realised at a large corporate group like GE. His conclusion&#58; Internal Service Design is important to simplify activities in a company.</p><p><a href="http&#58;//www.sinnerschrader.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9764537862_f6ba6f5764_z.jpg"><img alt="9764537862_f6ba6f5764_z" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3257" height="427" src="http&#58;//www.sinnerschrader.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/9764537862_f6ba6f5764_z.jpg" width="640"/></a></p></div>
