title: NEXT Service Design on 8 October in Berlin
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><strong>Today, a product is more than just the physical product itself&#58; A car2go is more than just a Smart, an iPod more than just an MP3 player. They are unmistakable because of the complementary services offered together with the product itself. And these are just two examples of successful service design.</strong></p><p>Experts from agencies, brands and science will discuss on 8 October 2012 at NEXT Service Design in Berlin how such products and supplementary services can be designed. Among the speakers will be service design pioneer Chris Downs (Method), Louisa Heinrich (Fjord) and David Bausola (Philter Phactory), who will present and discuss innovative approaches in their keynotes.</p><p><strong>Service Design</strong><br/>Service design is rapidly gaining importance. Companies realise that they can break away from competitors by offering innovative complementary services. In doing so, they are also able to generate growth – even in mature markets.<br/>Service design considers all touch points between product and customer. How can these be planned, designed and managed in a way that creates added value, which exceeds the mere product?</p><p><strong>NEXT Service Design</strong><br/>Blundstone Osterberger (Managing Director SinnerSchrader) and Peter Bihr (Founder and CEO of ThirdWave) curate the programme of NEXT SD. The European conference for service design and design methods is organised by the NEXT Berlin team, and the digital agency SinnerSchrader.</p><p><strong>The Speakers</strong><br/>In 2001, Chris Downs (Method) founded the world’s first agency for Service Design.

Currently she is Director at Fjord, an international agency for digital service design. David Bausola is CEO of Philter Phactory.
