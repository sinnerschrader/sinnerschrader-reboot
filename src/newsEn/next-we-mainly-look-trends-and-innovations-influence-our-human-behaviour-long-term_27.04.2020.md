title: For NEXT we mainly look for trends and innovations that influence our human behaviour in the long term.
content: <div class="newsbody"> <p>Ina Feistritzer, Head of NEXT, talks about her work for the digital conference</p> <p><strong>Ina, as the Head of NEXT, you’re in charge of activities for the content and event brand NEXT. What exactly does that mean?</strong><br/> <br/> The work I do is quite varied. I would say that the goal of my work is to bring concepts that are sometimes abstract to life. What I mostly do is look for exciting experts and topics and turn them into relevant programmes and content. Then I take care of stakeholder management – everything that we do is only possible with our partners and a lot of people involved. Marketing is naturally at the heart of all this. And fortunately, I’m not on my own for that – I have a great team of curators, editors, marketeers and designers.</p> <p><strong>What topics do you find interesting?</strong><br/> <br/> We come up with topics and ideas at other conferences, for example. It goes without saying that we’re looking at a lot of digital events at the moment. And I listen to podcasts and talks, most recently the ones by Azeem Azhar or Rana el Kaliouby. And I read newsletters, articles and Medium posts, like those by trend analysts like David Mattin and Benedict Evans. A lot of good input is generated by the NEXT team. And by the strategists and designers at our agency as well, who we mainly talk with on Slack channels or our internal platform.<br/> <br/> For NEXT we mainly look for trends and innovations that influence our human behaviour in the long term – so in good times and bad. Then we try to turn those into lessons that we can teach to product developers, designers and brand strategists. Then we bring it all to life&#58; in conference formats, at smaller events, or in blogs or podcasts.</p> <p><strong>What do you think makes the NEXT brand unique?</strong><br/> <br/> NEXT helps people to take on new ways of looking at digital business. We deliver ideas from different spheres and disciplines – including science, art, culture and different corners of our world. We work with topics that might take a second look before you grasp their relevance for product managers or CMOs but that might be vital to the job they do and the areas they need to be up to date on in order to generate new stimulus. <br/> And NEXT presents content in unusual settings and with a sophisticated design.</p> <p><strong>Tell us what NEXT still has in store for this year?</strong><br/> <br/> My answer to that would have been different at the beginning of the year. But now it’s clear that the big conference won’t be taking place as usual this year for obvious reasons. But alongside the big annual event in September, we’ve had small NEXT formats for a long time as well – like at the last OMR Festival or even just meeting with exciting people in someone’s living room. We hope that we will be able to resume these intimate events again in the course of the year.<br/> <br/> We are also planning a regular digital NEXT show. It’ll be chaired by our favourite keynoter David Mattin and our curator Monique van Dusseldorp, and we intend to talk to international experts about “What’s NEXT” and entertain and inspire people for 45 to 60 minutes. Other digital formats for different target groups will follow.</p> <p><strong>What has changed since you joined NEXT?</strong><br/> <br/> I first came to NEXT in 2012, when I was in charge of looking after the journalists. NEXT opened up a completely new universe to me as a cultural and media creative. I remember being at <a href="https&#58;//nextconf.eu/2012/05/alexander-bard-the-internet-revolution/" target="_blank">Alexander Bard’s</a> talk and thinking&#58; “WOW, we can do anything!" Until then, I hadn’t realised how much is possible with digital technology or how much it impacts our lives without us noticing. And since then there have been more and more people who open my eyes with their expertise and the way they think. <br/> What I can say is that, after all these years, the public at large is a lot more aware of digital issues than they used to be. It was a lot nerdier in 2012. Nowadays, you even see the issues we’ve been dealing with for what feels like a thousand years being reporting on by the major news networks – and that’s only recently been the case. And digital innovations that we’ve presented at NEXT over the years have now become part of our everyday lives&#58; crowdfunding, car sharing, start-ups like Spotify or <a href="https&#58;//nextconf.eu/2012/06/airbnb-a-marketplace-for-extraordinary-places-to-stay/" target="_blank">AirBnB</a>, to name just a few.</p> <p><strong>Do you have any particular memories that stand out to you personally?</strong><br/> <br/> I’d never been a big fan of events just for women. I’ve always believed that women have to get into the thick of things rather than “hiding away” at our own events. But thanks to a Global Digital Women event put on by our agency, I realised that this kind of event can really be very special and work wonders for your network. And so at NEXT19, we arranged a women’s lunch for the first time with 100 fantastic people and a very intimate atmosphere. <br/> And every now and then, there are individual speakers who can really work the room thanks to their style or their topics – either digitally or analogue. We recently had that at NEXT with Eliza Filby and <a href="https&#58;//nextconf.eu/2019/09/christian-mio-loclair-how-art-will-help-to-understand-ai-and-humanity/" target="_blank">Christian Mio Loclaire</a> especially.</p> <p><strong>What can you tell us about your private life?</strong><br/> <br/> When I’m not working, I like to commune with nature – rummaging in the garden or taking my children hiking, under protest, in the woods. I rarely get the chance to read something just for myself – it’s usually connected to NEXT in some way. The last thing I read was a book called “Sprache und Sein” by an author from Hamburg, Kübra Gümüşay, where she describes how language shapes the way we think and our politics.<br/> And obviously, my two boys make sure that I never have a dull moment. And through them, I get to see trends in completely different ways. They show me things in real life that I would otherwise only read about in professional journals – like TikTok, Fortnite or Minecraft.</p> <p><strong>Save the Date&#58;</strong><br/> Moderated by long-time conference curator Monique van Dusseldorp, NEXT keynoter-in-residence David Mattin and NEXT editor-in-chief Ina Feistritzer, the show will be streamed live every week. Registration is free of charge via <a href="http&#58;//nextconf.eu/live-content/" target="_blank">nextconf.eu/live-content/</a>.</p> </div>
