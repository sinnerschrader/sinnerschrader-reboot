title: ONE YEAR OF USER RESEARCH IN REMOTE TIMES&#58; A REFLECTION
content: <div class="newsbody"> <p>In early March 2020, we proposed to conduct contextual user research where we would interview people on their comparison process when buying a car. We set up a research plan, recruited for interviews, designed participatory conversation objects, and, as always, had everything ready to go. Within twenty-four hours, a strict lockdown was imposed in Germany, and we quickly realized we had to shift our way of working immediately. It seemed so dramatic at the time, but little did we know that this mode of working would become the norm for all of 2020. Now, after almost one year of home office and involving users remotely, we wanted to reflect on the research we did within the limitations of the pandemic and share with you which doors opened for us, which doors closed, and how we want to move forward in the future. </p> <p>Being forced to quickly adapt to a new mode of working did not slow our research down, as one might have initially expected. Of course, as user researchers, we were already familiar with remote tools and methods, but what caught us off guard was how to reframe research that was initially supposed to be face-to-face into something remote. In converting the research setup, we were not quite sure if everything would go as we had imagined. We weren’t sure if we could get the same effect out of our interactive materials in a remote setting, as we would if we spoke with the participants in person. In the end, however, the transition turned out to be a relatively smooth process. Throughout the year, we ended up learning a lot from each of our research engagements and managed to successfully refine our methods, tools, tasks, and the way we communicate within the team accordingly. </p> <p><strong>Doors that have opened for us in terms of remote research</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Quick adaptation of methods</strong><br/> The first interview that we converted into a remote setting involved a lot of jerry-rigging. The interview questions remained the same, but we had to adapt our planned interview activities to make sure we could carry them out remotely. For example, one activity was for the user to draw out their car buying process on paper, so we could get a better idea of their personal experience. We asked the recruiters ahead of time to make sure the participants had a paper and pen handy during the interview and asked them to share their screen and hold up the paper in front of the webcam. Most of the time the webcam quality was so bad, that we couldn’t see what the participants wrote on their paper. This meant they had to take additional time to explain what they drew. This process of drawing first and then explaining the drawing all over again, allowed the participant to reflect while speaking and actually ended up bringing depth to the conversation. While reformatting the activities wasn’t 100% ideal, we still managed to work around the issue without any major hiccups. Once we knew things would be remote for a while, it was easier to plan the research within this new context. It made it possible for us to plan accordingly from the beginning and avoid twists, turns, and surprises.<br/> </li> <li><strong>The recruiting process becomes easier</strong><br/> Recruiters are already familiar with remote situations and it ends up being easier to get people to participate in our research if they can stay at home rather than come to our office. It also encourages a more diverse set of people to participate regardless of where they live.<br/> </li> <li><strong>Less time required to set up remote usability tests</strong><br/> There is no need to set up live streaming across physical rooms, organize and prepare a suitable testing location with all the technical equipment, welcome participants in the lobby, or familiarize them with the location. <br/> </li> <li><strong>Participants are more comfortable speaking to us within the comfort of their own home</strong><br/> We quickly discovered that the participants are more relaxed and, as a result, more communicative, due to the nature of the familiar set up in their own home.<br/> </li> <li><strong>The use of technology within the context of the home is explored in an authentic way </strong><br/> If people experience technical difficulties, have their kids screaming in the background, or have their partner helping them with the technical set up, it provides us with a nice picture of what really goes on in their daily lives. These distractions could easily occur when the participants are using the website or the app we are testing in a natural setting, which is something we wouldn’t see if we conducted the interview in a controlled environment. This provides us with insights regarding how to deal with distraction and how it affects the design and experience of the product.<br/> </li> <li><strong>Gaining valuable insights on a major cultural shift </strong><br/> We can second-handedly explore how people interact with technology within the context of a pandemic, which is not something you can simulate in an everyday setting.<br/> </li> <li><strong>Smoother line of communication within the team during interviews</strong><br/> It is easier for the interviewer to be in direct contact with the notetaker without distracting the participant. Diverse members of the team can easily observe interviews simply by joining the virtual room without making the participant feel uncomfortable. Because of this setup, the observers can easily pass on questions to the interviewer, who can then incorporate them into the flow of the conversation without interruption.<br/> </li> <li><strong>Opportunity to strengthen and optimize quantitative methods </strong><br/> Quantitative methods generally don’t leave much room for creativity, but throughout the year we have had the time and space to figure out how to infuse our creative methods within these generally rigid studies. We have been finding new ways to provoke users out of their habitual way of thinking through unconventional survey structures and asking questions in unique ways. <br/> </li> <li><strong>Discovery of new tools</strong><br/> We are using several tools to assist us in conducting user research that we probably would not have otherwise become aware of. One such tool is <a href="https&#58;//lookback.io/" target="_blank">Lookback.io</a>, which allows you to conduct remote moderated usability tests on desktop or mobile devices. We also use <a href="https&#58;//maze.co/#kh5yu4sq8y-" target="_blank">Maze</a>, which is a web tool for surveys and prototypes that allows you to quickly test your product at scale before starting the development process. <br/> </li> <li><strong>Quicker digitized analysis</strong><br/> Besides changing our way of conducting research, we have also had to figure out a new way of analyzing research material. Our previous chaos of clustering and analyzing with post-its on our office walls has to be done digitally now. To make this possible, we’ve discovered the world of digital collaborative whiteboards. In <a href="https&#58;//www.mural.co/" target="_blank">Mural</a>, we take notes during interviews and usability tests, cluster the respective quotes and remarks, and then uncover patterns and insights. We’ve quickly recognized the advantages of this collaborative way of working with multiple people and perspectives on one topic. Not only is it more organized, but having everything digitally concentrated in one place reduces the risk that you lose thoughts, steps, or notes within the course of the research as well as in the future. Another advantage is that all researchers and relevant team members have access to the information at all times. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Things that become more difficult with remote research</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Increased legal ramifications </strong><br/> With the use of new tools come a plethora of legal issues. We’ve had to figure out how standardized processes, such as signing a non-disclosure agreement, could be customized to the remote situation, keeping legal ramifications in mind. We’ve also had to learn how to deal with data privacy in a remote setting by setting up special agreements between the client, the recruiting agency, and our company. In our surveys, we now have to add a clause stating our legal terms and conditions, which allows participants to only continue and view sensitive material if they agree to the terms. It sounds relatively simple, but it always ends up becoming a legal struggle.<br/> </li> <li><strong>Limited use of certain methods &amp; activities</strong><br/> Remote research has also restricted us in our use of certain research methods. Ethnographic methods, for example, are limited in how we can interact with participants because we can’t go out into the field. While we can get a realistic picture of what happens in people's homes during the pandemic, real-time observations and explorations of different contexts become difficult since both the researchers and participants are limited to their home. As a result, creative, participatory activities in our research have become a little bit harder to carry out. <br/> </li> <li><strong>Frequent technical difficulties</strong><br/> Of course, with remote research, many technical issues arise, such as, low-quality webcams, cameras that are not connected, and bad internet connections. In trying to avoid or work around these problems, we’ve learned that providing the participants with a detailed briefing beforehand, as well as close cooperation with the recruiting agencies concerning the handling of legal processes, eases many things during the execution of the research. <br/> </li> <li><strong>Communication with participant suffers</strong><br/> Not only do technical difficulties affect the quality of the conversations, but it is difficult to see the facial expressions and gestures of the participants. Body language and expressions are vital cues that help us interpret what the participant is saying and what they mean, and this was a bit lost in a remote setting.<br/> </li> <li><strong>Valuable human interaction during analysis decreases</strong><br/> The analysis has become a bit more individualized. Post-its that you previously took in your hand, shared out loud with your colleagues, and then clustered together in a shared conversation are now being pushed from left to right by everyone individually in a digital setting. Thus, this rich, mutual discussion is often lost in the process. <br/> </li> <li><strong>The way of communicating within the research team has to adapt</strong><br/> Not only does the communication with the participants suffer, but the way we communicate within our team has become more difficult. At the beginning of the pandemic, creative brainstorming sessions which often arose naturally from sitting together in an office space felt forced and unsuccessful. This disconnection to the workplace along with using a lot of our energy to navigate changing external circumstances caused low levels of motivation in our research. The fire that all of us usually have within us to explore new approaches and propose creative research methods had to be rekindled first. We now have found ways of supporting, inspiring, and lifting each other up by continuously communicating, not only within the work context but also beyond. Recurring reconciliations at least three times a week guarantee that we are not only up to date with our tasks, but that we challenge and inspire each other and, above all, look out for each other's well-being.</li> </ul> <p>Looking back, this new way of conducting user research was in no way a setback, but rather an opportunity to try new things, to leave usual ways of working behind, and to explore new methods. We learned that there is a seamless transition between different modes of conducting user research. Like any method used, there are always strengths and weaknesses, and it’s simply a matter of balancing them out, regardless of if the research is remote, in-person, or a combination of both. In the future, we will continue to combine different methods and approaches to ensure that we gain a holistic understanding of our customers. We will continue to employ remote methods when we do surveys, diary studies, card sorting, etc., especially in a setting where we need to speak to large numbers of people. For studies where a contextual analysis is necessary or we need to get closer to our participants, we hope to be able to conduct in-person research again soon! </p> <p>ℹ️ <strong>Infobox</strong><br/> Overview of our remote research methods and tools with their corresponding strengths and weaknesses</p> <p><strong>Remote moderated Usability Testing </strong></p> <p>Strength&#58;</p> <ul> <li>Participants use our products in their natural environment</li> <li>Participants feel more comfortable opening up within the comfort of their own home  </li> <li>Communicating with team members during the testing without disturbing the participant becomes easier </li> <li>Including people from different locations in the testing is possible </li> </ul> <p> Weakness&#58;</p> <ul> <li>Technical problems that occur are hard to fix or workaround</li> <li>Technical problems can delay the testing </li> <li>A bad internet connection can make the testing difficult </li> <li>Facial expressions and gestures of the participants can easily get lost </li> </ul> <p>Tools&#58;</p> <ul> <li>GoToMeeting&#58;<br/> Allows the conducting of Usability Tests on mobile and desktop without the participants needing to register anywhere </li> <li>Lookback&#58;<br/> Is designed specifically for conducting remote moderated as well as unmoderated Usability Tests</li> </ul> <p><strong>Remote Interviews </strong></p> <p>Strength&#58;</p> <ul> <li>Remote Interviews <span style="white-space&#58;pre"> </span>Participants are in the comfort of their home, therefore opening up more easily </li> <li>Recruiting people for remote interviews is easier</li> <li>You don't need to organize and prepare a suitable testing location </li> </ul> <p> Weakness&#58;</p> <ul> <li>A bad internet connection can disturb the interview</li> <li>Facial expressions and gestures of the participants can easily get lost </li> </ul> <p>Tools&#58;<br/> <br/> GoToMeeting&#58;<br/> Allows you to easily conduct remote interviews, without the participants needing to register anywhere or downloading something</p> <p><strong>Online unmoderated Usability Testing </strong></p> <p>Strength&#58;</p> <ul> <li>Conducting rapid Usability Test with a bigger sample </li> <li>Quick validation of small design questions </li> </ul> <p> Weakness&#58;</p> <ul> <li>Fully understanding the “Why”</li> <li>Possible reduction in sample and answer quality </li> </ul> <p>Tools&#58;<br/> <br/> Maze&#58;<br/> In Maze, you can upload one prototype and give users several missions to complete.
