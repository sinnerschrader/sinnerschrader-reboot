title: SinnerSchrader Commerce launches online flagship store for Parador
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><a href="http&#58;//www.parador.de/">www.parador.de</a></p><p>SinnerSchrader Commerce has developed an online flagship store for premium flooring manufacturer Parador, which exclusively stages the Parador brand and facilitates the online purchase of their complex and diverse product range including laminate, engineered wood and resilient flooring. With this flagship store, Parador is the first manufacturer of its segment to emerge with online direct sales and in doing so, has revolutionized their brand presence.</p><p>One of the unique challenges of selling flooring online is the extended buyer decision process of three to six months. Parador’s new online presence optimally accompanies its online customers throughout this process, offering expert information on each product line and premium editorial content in the section “Living Performance”. By digitalizing the award-winning magazine “Boden”, with articles on flooring, sustainability and commitment, SinnerSchrader Commerce has succeeded in transferring quality to the online sector. The section entitled “Design” features renown Parador designers like Hadi Teherani.</p><p>The site’s razor-sharp display across all end devices is due to keenly considered vector formats and raster graphics. A true eye catcher, the site’s main navigation was implemented with the subtle use of CSS3 3-D animation.</p><p>The platform was designed with Shopware and auxiliary CMS components. Based on a mobile navigation concept which focuses on site content and allows the navigation to be masked if the user so desires, the off-canvas navigation was carried out across mobile and desktop. Parador’s products are portrayed in virtual spaces (CGI implementation by Active Online (http&#58;//www.active-online.de/). The site’s search and filters were implemented via FACT-Finder.</p><p>Hamburg e-commerce agency SinnerSchrader Commerce set itself apart from two competitors with a multi-stage pitch which acquired them a budget in the 6-figure range.</p><p><strong>Birgit Kunth, Director of Marketing at Parador&#58;</strong><br/>"SinnerSchrader Commerce clearly understands our brand and has combined premium content with our products. This is essential for a sophisticated audience who seeks comprehensive information before deciding to purchase Parador flooring. Customer confidence is obtained through an exclusive brand and product experience, all of which is united in a high-end e-commerce concept. This is what characterizes our new online flagship store."</p><p><strong>Matthias Müller, Team Lead Projects&#58;</strong><br/>"We are extremely pleased and proud that Parador responded to our progressive design approach and bold navigation concept. Parador has enabled us to build a Shopware platform which sets new standards in e-commerce for premium customers. We look forward to offering further conceptual services for Parador’s unique product range in the future.
