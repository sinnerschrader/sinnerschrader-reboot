title: Online wine retailer Hawesko presents new webshop
content: <div class="newsbody"><p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-2d937778-698b-3080-2503-d6c2b4deb6d9">Hamburg. Germany's largest mail order wine retailer, the Hanseatic Wein &amp; Sekt Kontor Hawesko relauched its new webshop<a href="http&#58;//www.hawesko.de" target="_blank"> www.hawesko.de</a> with a revised look, streamlined content and optimized customer experience. The conceptual development and design for the shop, including tablet variations, was led by the SinnerSchrader agency Commerce Plus. The technical concept, programming and design for smartphones were carried out by Medienwerft. "We weren’t seeking to make a radical change, but to expand on the existing shop and enrich it with new and interesting features. The focus is on customer experience. Our decisions were analytically driven with the intention of serving our customers’ needs and demands in the best possible way," comments Meidine Oltmanns, Director of E-commerce at Hawesko.</p><p dir="ltr">The new online brand environment, designed by Commerce Plus, reinforces Hawesko’s positioning as aficionado for an inspiring wine experience at a premium level. In this respect, an integral connection was made between online and offline presentation, in order to reach Hawesko’s multi-channel audience, who moves consistently between both distribution channels.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong> Responsive web design and new features</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Hawesko’s new brand presence focusses on responsive web design, aiming to offer the best possible shopping experience for all devices. To start, a refining concept was created, which tidied the shop contents and placed emphasis on sales and added value. The product range was then emotionally charged, for example with a behind the scenes look, a wine blog and a glossary of wine terminology. One highlight of the new shop, with respect to improved customer experience, is the new customer account, which allows the customer to create a personal taste profile in his “world of wine”, “store” his favorite wines, write reviews, as well as share experience with fellow wine connoisseurs.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition, Commerce Plus developed a detailed online style guide—based on new corporate design—which can be used for all webshop related online advertising. At the center of the new sales concept is audience conform user guidance. The gifts section for private and corporate customers, for example, was modified to suit the needs of both target groups&#58; corporate customers want quick search results and tend to order in large quantities, whereas private customers prefer to browse.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="http&#58;//www.commerce-plus.com/files/2013/05/pressebild_hawesko_300dpi.jpg" target="_blank">Download press photo Hawesko (300dpi)</a></p><p dir="ltr"><a href="http&#58;//www.commerce-plus.com/files/2013/05/Screenshot_Hawesko_Webshop.png" target="_blank">Download Screenshot1</a></p><p dir="ltr"><a href="http&#58;//www.commerce-plus.com/files/2013/05/Screenshot_Hawesko_Webshop2.png" target="_blank">Download Screenshot2</a></p></div>
