title: Over 6000 premium products&#58; Torquato.de in new responsive design by SinnerSchrader Commerce
content: <div class="newsbody"> <p dir="ltr">Luxury mail order retailer Torquato commissioned Commerce Plus to redesign their international shop <a href="http&#58;//www.torquato.de">http&#58;//www.torquato.de</a> of over 6000 products. One of the first German online shops of this scale, torquato.de was implemented in responsive design. The e-commerce agency was responsible for concept development, design, technical development and quality assurance. The result&#58; a high-performance, user-friendly state-of- the-art webshop with large-scale imagery and product presentation created with the e-commerce platform Magento.</p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Responsive Design</strong></p> <p dir="ltr">The sophisticated webshop is in responsive design, which means the design, more specifically the structure of individual elements such as navigation, images and text, is dynamic and responds to the demands of remote devices. The flexible gridded design can be adapted for widescreens as well as tablets. In summary, the shop offers a mobile version for smartphones with full webshop functionality, making apps for mobile devices no longer necessary. The implementation of responsive design has two primary benefits&#58; content maintenance for products must only be done in one system and secondly, responsive design utilizes the entire display area of the device for relevant content, so that the products may be optimally presented.</p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Shop highlights</strong></p> <p dir="ltr">Torquato’s extensive and premium product range serves a diverse range of customers. The product categories include Tableware &amp; Kitchenware, Eating &amp; Drinking, House &amp; Home, Bath &amp; Bodycare, Luggage &amp; Accessories, Paper &amp; Office and For Children &amp; Toys. One of the shop’s highlights is its bridal registry. Couples may register at torquato.de and create their wishlist from a broad-ranging array of products. In the stationery shop, an integrated tool allows users to create personalized business stationary and place printing orders directly.</p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Magento and performance</strong></p> <p dir="ltr">Developers at Commerce Plus in Hamburg, Hanover and Berlin implemented the webshop with Magento Enterprise Edition and enhanced the shop system with extensions and modules provided by their in-house D2C platform. Using the D2C cache module, a high- performance webshop was developed which offers fast page load times. This elementary conversion tool ensures easy shop access and in turn, places full focus on the shop’s product assortment. In addition, the order process was condensed into a "3-step checkout solution" in order to carry out the customer’s unique shopping experience through to checkout.</p> <p dir="ltr"><strong> Torquato directors, the Stürken brothers&#58;</strong></p> <p dir="ltr"><em>"We are pleased to provide our customers with a new online shop and a unique shopping experience across devices."</em></p> <p dir="ltr"> <strong>Moritz Koch, Managing Director at Commerce Plus&#58;</strong></p> <p dir="ltr"><em>"We are pleased to have implemented one of the first German online shops with such a large product range in responsive design together with Torquato. Making online shopping a pleasure on all remote devices, Torquato is well-equipped for the future."</em></p> <p><strong>Download </strong> Screenshots Torquato.de <a href="http&#58;//www.commerce-plus.com/files/2013/09/Torquato.de_CommercePlus_Desktop.png" target="_blank">Desktop</a>, <a href="http&#58;//www.commerce-plus.com/files/2013/09/Torquato.de_CommercePlus_Tablet.png" target="_blank">Tablet1</a>, <a href="http&#58;//www.commerce-plus.com/files/2013/09/Torquato.de_CommercePlus_Tablet2.png" target="_blank">Tablet2</a>, <a href="http&#58;//www.commerce-plus.com/files/2013/09/Torquato.de_CommercePlus_Smartphones.png" target="_blank">Smartphone</a> and <a href="http&#58;//www.commerce-plus.com/files/2013/09/Torquato_Logo_Balken_Claim.pdf" target="_blank">logo Torquato</a><a href="http&#58;//www.commerce-plus.com/files/2013/09/Torquato_Logo_Balken_Claim.pdf" target="_blank">.</a></p> <p><strong>Contact&#58;</strong></p> <p dir="ltr">Sebastian Kehr<br/> +49 40 24828 751<br/> <a href="mailto&#58;kehr@commerce-plus.com">kehr@commerce-plus.com</a></p> <p dir="ltr"><a href="http&#58;//www.commerce-plus.com">http&#58;//www.commerce-plus.com<br/> </a><a href="https&#58;//twitter.com/commerceplus1">https&#58;//twitter.com/commerceplus1<br/> </a><a href="http&#58;//www.facebook.com/commerceplus1">http&#58;//www.facebook.com/commerceplus1<br/> </a><a href="https&#58;//plus.google.com/102899388550483827030">https&#58;//plus.google.com/102899388550483827030</a></p> </div>
