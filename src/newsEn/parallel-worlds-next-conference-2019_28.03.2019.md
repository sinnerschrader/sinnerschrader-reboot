title: Parallelwelten at the NEXT Conference 2019
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><em>Leading digital conference, NEXT, announces this year’s theme and provides rare new food for thought</em></p><p>“Parallelwelten”<em> sees digitalisation in five different dimensions&#58; global, local, technological, entrepreneurial and scientific</em></p><p><strong>Hamburg, March 2019</strong> – Over 1,500 digital decision-makers, forward thinkers and creative minds from businesses and organisations will convene at NEXT, the international digital conference on the Reeperbahn in Hamburg, on 19 and 20 September 2019. Together, they will discuss technology trends and new realities for users and businesses under this year’s theme, “Parallelwelten”.</p><p>30 years since its invention, the Internet has connected the whole world, but also contributed to its fragmentation. People disappear into their own universes, create parallel existences for themselves and perceive reality differently. When we look at these parallel worlds, we have come a long way from merely talking about filter bubbles, company silos or fake news.</p><p>“Our reality is increasingly defined by digital products and technologies, which gives us more freedom than ever before. Our analogue and digital lives have long since merged – not into a single world, but rather into many different ones,” says Matthias Schrader, founder of NEXT, CEO of SinnerSchrader/Managing Director of Accenture Interactive DACH. “These realities coexist, sometimes outside of our perception. In the best case, we can choose the one that we find most promising.”</p><p>At NEXT19, various dimensions of our digital existence will be made visible, and influencers will build bridges between the parallel worlds. NEXT19 speakers from Europe, China, Africa and the USA will highlight digital developments on every continent and their significance for people and markets in Germany. Parallel innovation processes will be illuminated, and there will be discussion on how technologies such as AI, voice, VR or quantum computing are adding to our lives layer by layer, world by world. </p><p>"Parallel worlds can now be found in almost every company with an established digital strategy. Innovation departments and digital hubs are building the future with new culture and flexible rules - at the same time the previous identity and product world of the company earns money," says Volker Martens, co-organizer of NEXT and CEO of FAKTOR 3. "The management of these internal parallel worlds is an essential part of successful corporate management."</p><p><em>We live in parallel worlds, with a shared responsibility.</em></p><p>At NEXT19, we investigate these <strong>Parallelwelten</strong> from five different angles&#58; global, local, technological, corporate and scientific.</p><p><strong>Global Parallelwelten&#58; Other Worlds</strong><br/>We tend to forget that life isn’t confined to Silicon Valley. We’ll take an open look at what’s growing fast in China, India and selected African countries. What do these developments mean for people and companies in Europe?</p><p><strong>Local Parallelwelten&#58; Fragmentation</strong><br/>Whether it’s the urban-rural divide, the generation gap, or any other cause of division, humans are diving deeper into their own universes and decoupling themselves from one another in favour of new tribal structures. This fragmentation presents a behemoth task for companies, both internally and in how they define their target groups. Politics isn’t immune from this fragmentation and faces a huge challenge in reaching people in these new tribal realities. So how do we bring these worlds together and build bridges between them? </p><p><strong>Technological Parallelwelten&#58; New Realities</strong><br/>Code permeates our lives like an invisible dimension. We talk to voice systems, allow our knowledge to be controlled by algorithms, analyse our emotions with machines, observe ourselves through computers, and fight digital wars. How does this invisible dimension affect our reality? And what is happening beneath the surface without us realising?</p><p><strong>Corporate Parallelwelten&#58; Parallel Innovation</strong><br/>How do you continuously improve existing products while simultaneously developing new ideas with transformational potential? How can parallel innovation structures go beyond pure efficiency and help us to answer this increasingly important question? </p><p><strong>Scientific Parallelwelten - Quantum et al.</strong><br/>Quantum mechanics, the ‘harbinger’ of parallel worlds, has made an important breakthrough&#58; quantum computing is about to leave the lab. It’s a fascinating technology that goes beyond the binary logic that dominated the early 21st century. What possibilities is it likely to open up for us in the years to come?</p></div>
