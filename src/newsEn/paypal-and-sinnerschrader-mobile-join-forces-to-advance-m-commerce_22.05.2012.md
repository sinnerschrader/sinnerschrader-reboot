title: PayPal and SinnerSchrader Mobile join forces to advance M-Commerce
content: <div class="newsbody"><p>One in every three Germans now owns a smartphone, and more and more are using them to shop online. The mobile payment service provider PayPal and the agency SinnerSchrader Mobile aim to further promote this trend. The companies have signed a collaboration to make it easier for brands and retailers to take the step into mobile commerce and help them be successful there.</p><p>PayPal has already optimised its payment products with this in mind – from checkout to payment processing. In 2011 alone, the company processed mobile transactions for goods worth $4 billion, and it expects this to nearly double to $7 billion this year. This change in user behaviour by millions of smartphone owners opens up valuable new opportunities for including all sales channels such as retail stores, online shops, catalogues and outdoor advertising in retailer-to-customer communications. A coherent overall concept that understands mobile devices as a catalyst for innovation in retail is essential in this. Crucial factors for success here include optimising the online shop for the size of mobile screens and developing branded apps that ensure a positive user experience and prevent aborted transactions. Over the last few months PayPal has observed that shops that are not optimised for mobile or that do not have their own app indeed generate much lower turnover.</p><p>As a partner of the eBay subsidiary, SinnerSchrader Mobile uses PayPal payment systems in developing mobile web apps and high-performance m-commerce solutions that facilitate convenient shopping on smartphones and tablets.</p><p>As a full-service mobile agency, SinnerSchrader Mobile focuses not only on technical implementation, but also serves customers from the strategy and concept development stage to design and marketing. Its clients include Unitymedia, DuMont and Das Örtliche. The Berlin-based SinnerSchrader subsidiary specialises in mobile websites, apps, TV applications, in-car systems and m-commerce solutions.</p><p>Henri Kühnert, Managing Director of SinnerSchrader Mobile, says&#58; "Traffic from mobile devices like smartphones and tablets is increasing massively. More and more retailers are recognising this business case and are aligning themselves accordingly. Customers will buy on their mobiles if the site is tailored to mobile use. This is what SinnerSchrader Mobile and PayPal as a payment processor specialise in."</p><p>"Retailers are advised to actively embrace the enormous opportunities associated with mobile commerce and mobile payments, to exploit growth impulses on the one hand and defend themselves against innovative competitors on the other. No one can afford not to pursue this trend any longer," says Holger Spielberg, Head of Mobile Payments and Innovation at PayPal.</p><p><strong>About SinnerSchrader Mobile</strong><br/>SinnerSchrader Mobile is a full-service mobile agency in Berlin.
