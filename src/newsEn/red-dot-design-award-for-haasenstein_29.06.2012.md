title: red dot design award for Haasenstein
content: <div class="newsbody"><p>An international jury has honoured <a href="http&#58;//haasenstein.com">creative agency Haasenstein</a> with the <a href="http&#58;//de.red-dot.org/">red dot design award</a> for its corporate design. The jurors examined more than 6,800 submitted works from 43 countries.</p><p>Ferdinand Haasenstein founded Germany’s first advertising agency in <strong>1855</strong> in the Altona district of Hamburg. In 2011 SinnerSchrader revived this almost forgotten history as <a href="http&#58;//haasenstein.com">creative agency Haasenstein</a>&#58; <a href="http&#58;//haasenstein.com">http&#58;//haasenstein.com</a>.</p><p><strong>Industrialisation</strong> had changed the market so much by 1855 that the company saw the need for a new form of communication. These days it is <strong>digitalisation</strong> that is revolutionising the relationship between company and brand and the consumer.</p><p>Then as now, Haasenstein stands for a <strong>new kind of communication</strong>. In underlining its origins, Haasenstein has deliberately gone against the modern design of digital agencies. The result is a <strong>combination</strong> of analog à la 1855 and today’s digital format.</p></div>
