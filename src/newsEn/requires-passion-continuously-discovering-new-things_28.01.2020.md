title: This requires a passion for continuously discovering new things
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><strong>In her role as “Director Strategy”, Daniela Kirchner dives deeply into new worlds of working and living together with her colleagues...</strong></p><p><strong>What background do you have and what does a strategist need?</strong></p><p>My background is more atypical for an agency than it is traditional. I worked at a corporation, the Otto Group, for more than eight years and studied industrial engineering before that. I considered studying architecture, technical design or communication design, all of which I find fascinating, but then I realised the amazing skills the people actually doing those things had. And I decided that was beyond me. ;-)<br/>My studies in my current area of professional activity benefited me because I was repeatedly thrown in at the deep end without fundamental knowledge in areas such as design theory and forced to either sink or swim. You have to be able to cope with a wide range of topics in a short space of time. You could compare it to a pitch situation in an agency environment&#58; You are presented with a new subject that you have never heard of before, and you have to quickly figure out what you have at your disposal in terms of methods, presentations and expertise. You have to keep adopting new customer perspectives and imagining different user worlds – the things that catch on and the things that are needed. That makes it an extremely varied job.</p><p><strong>What makes a good strategist? And what makes your work at our company so special?</strong></p><p>All of the strategists in our team have a different background, which is cool. That means there is no such thing as THE strategist or THE profile. What we have in common is our desire to realise a specific benefit, a specific objective for a digital product. We combine different aspects and different people and translate the whole thing into a language and form that our customers can understand. This requires a passion for continuously discovering new things, creativity in its various manifestations and a desire to communicate.<br/>Strategists have a reputation of being a bit too cerebral and always overthinking things a little – and I suspect that’s not altogether incorrect. ;-)<br/><br/>What I essentially find so good about SinnerSchrader is that we don’t simply open a drawer and pull out a tailor-made solution. We always start with a blank sheet of paper and work with the customer and employees from UX, data, design, technology and project management to develop something. In the best case, we provide strategic support from start to finish, helping the team to keep their eyes on the goal at all times and successfully negotiate one level after the next.<br/><br/>This allows you to play an active role in all parts of the process, continuously develop and fulfil yourself to a certain extent. The sense of togetherness we have here means you are always learning something from and with your colleagues.</p><p><strong>What is the key issue that keeps cropping up?</strong></p><p>What is the actual problem we are trying to solve and for whom? What drives the people concerned (customers in the sense of users but also our clients), and what are their needs and goals? We start by tackling these questions and trying to get to the bottom of them.<br/>We also look at what is already in place. How is “digital” defined? How do the people concerned work? What will help them the most? And is our assignment really what they ultimately need?</p><p><strong>What is the worst thing that can happen?</strong></p><p>At the micro level, the worst thing is when a workshop concept proves unsuccessful or a method is not accepted – then you have to spontaneously come up with something else.<br/>At the macro level, the worst thing is when a project gets bogged down or fails to be realised. When it comes to strategy, it is important to think and plan with actual feasibility in mind right from the very start.</p><p><strong>What lies at the heart of a digital strategist’s work?</strong></p><p>A toolbox that you can use flexibly, including service design methods, research methods, product concepts, metrics, analytical methods, ideation formats, scenario techniques and storytelling.</p><p><strong>When is a strategy also innovation?</strong></p><p>When innovation can be felt by the end user.<br/>It is not a matter of simply establishing a new technology and saying that you have achieved something innovative. It is about products and services that do not yet exist and that will improve the user’s everyday life. The strategy leads the way. What are the user’s specific needs? You have to look past the dogmas and hypes of the market and see what will be a good fit for your customer and their brand. Coming to these conclusions is the role of a strategy. <br/>In order to be innovative, you have to set yourself challenging targets that ensure you are actually solving a problem and not “only” developing a product.</p><p><strong>How do you stay up to date and keep finding new ideas for new strategic approaches?</strong></p><p>Specialist books from neighbouring areas such as software development are helpful. “Accelerate” is one example. I have just got my hands on a load of books about brand design and storytelling. And, of course, it is important to engage in a dialogue with my colleagues and other agencies from the Accenture network, like Fjord or Design Affairs. Conferences like Techfestival in Copenhagen are another source of inspiration.</p><p><strong>Do you always make decisions using a sophisticated strategy, or do you sometimes let your gut feeling decide?</strong></p><p>Your experience in particular means your gut feeling might well be right, but that doesn’t cut it when it comes to presenting a line of argument to a customer.<br/>In other words, the old saying about making decisions using your gut is only partially accurate, and a proper user survey is the remedy. You should always be aware that your brain is full of hypotheses, and surveys can sometimes prevail over your gut feeling. It is important to obtain a wide range of expert opinions and perspectives. For me, an analytical approach that embraces all of the available information is the right approach.</p><p><strong>And is there a simple strategy for a successful working day? </strong></p><p>I start the week by looking at my appointments and block some free time every day, then I plan this free time properly so that I can concentrate on my work or actively meet people with whom I work on a specific topic. All in all, this gives me a good balance between focused work and dialogue.</p><p><strong>Does a strategist have a strategy for their own life?</strong></p><p>No. Not a fixed plan, anyway! &#58;-) </p><p><a class="news-backlink" href="/en/"><svg class="svg-ico svg-ico--arrow-left"><use xlink&#58;href="#arrow-down"></use></svg>Back to the overview</a></p></div>
