title: Sandra Zollner, Junior Product Engineer
content: <div class="newsbody"><p>"I like the process of working together to create something, to make something new!"<br/><br/>Sandra Zollner works as a Junior Product Engineer in the studio of SinnerSchrader in Munich. She came to SinnerSchrader during her studies via OPEN DOORS, which will take place this year on 27 November 2018 in Berlin, Frankfurt and Hamburg, and on 04 December 2018 in Munich. Registration at <a href="mailto&#58;opendoor@sinnerschrader.com">opendoor@sinnerschrader.com</a>.</p><p><strong>How did you first hear about SinnerSchrader?</strong><br/>From the Open Doors Day, which all interested students can take part in across different cities. The culture at the Munich studio and the atmosphere among the employees appealed to me immediately, but what convinced me was that they talked a lot about UX. Design combined with technology, interdisciplinary work - this was just the thing for me. My degree in media technology also focused on this.</p><p><strong>What exactly do you do at our company?</strong><br/>I have just finished onboarding a new project and have to work with new technologies. For this purpose, I am learning React and TypeScript and gaining insights into back-end frameworks. This is all for the front-end implementation of a React web application.</p><p><strong>What kind of jobs do you enjoy the most?</strong><br/>I like developing both smaller and larger features with frameworks like Angular and React; I really enjoy coding. I also like consulting with creative workers in order to find the best solution together. As well as the technical implementation, I always keep an eye on the user experience and aesthetics, too.<br/>I like the process of working together to create something, to make something new!</p><p><strong>What is important to you in daily business?</strong><br/>Communication, team play and transparency within a company are top priorities for me. Understanding why decisions are made, being informed. Being able to talk about problems as well as positive feedback is something that I see as a sign of respect for me on the part of my colleagues and supervisors. Continuous learning, for example by means of good projects that challenge you, is also important to me. </p><p><strong>Why Munich?</strong><br/>I was born in Munich and have developed roots here, both personally and professionally. My favourite places here&#58; </p><ul><li>Having a beer after work by the river Isar/the Wittelsbacherbrücke bridge</li><li>Lunch at Orange Box (tip&#58; halloumi wraps)</li><li>Concerts at Milla </li><li>Attentat Griechischer Salat restaurant</li><li>Gärtnerplatz</li><li>Barbecue parties on our SinnerSchrader terrace in Munich, whether it’s with customers or for our summer party</li></ul><p><strong>What do you like to do online, which apps do you use?</strong><br/>I could listen to music all day long, so Spotify is my favourite app. I also use the Zeit news app, Nike Run Club, airbnb and Instagram, and I chat a lot on WhatsApp, Telegram and Facebook.<br/>I would like to launch an app in the social sphere or for environmental protection, e.g. an app that helps people integrate...</p></div>
