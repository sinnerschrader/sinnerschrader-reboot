title: SinnerSchrader back to double digit growth in the fourth quarter of 2011/2012
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><strong>Figures for the whole financial year in line with the most recent forecast</strong></p><p>With total revenue in the amount of more than 9 million euros and EBITA in the range of 0.5 million euros, SinnerSchrader made up ground in the fourth quarter of 2011/2012 (1 June to 31 August 2012) after a difficult third quarter.</p><p>Revenue growth in the fourth quarter, in comparison to the same quarter in the preceding year, was back in the double-digit range. With the ŠKODA decision in favour of SinnerSchrader as a global digital lead agency, the SinnerSchrader agency also asserted itself in the face of competition against national and international rivals in the quarter of the report, and gained a significant new customer. SinnerSchrader Mobile also contributed to the positive development of business, with pleasing increases in revenue and more new customers, among which mobilcom-debitel and Karstadt. spot-media won through in the face of competition for a customer operating in the mineral oil industry.</p><p>The business development of spot-media, and the capacity adjustments implemented in June that became necessary as a result of this development, had a considerable, negative effect on the operating result (EBITA) of the quarter, even if this result was again clearly positive.</p><p>There were also further operative losses in the adserving business. These losses were due to the reorientation of the newtention Group, which was renamed Next Audience, together with an enforced expansion of the sales and marketing capacity. The reorientation resulted from the excessively weak development of the retargeting business in the mementoo network, on the one hand, and new market dynamics for advertisers in the field of audience management, on the other hand. With the new business approach, Next Audience already gained Bigpoint, one of the world’s largest suppliers of online games, as a pilot customer.</p><p>On the basis of the provisional, unaudited figures of the Consolidated Financial Statements, net revenue for the 2011/2012 financial year was just under 36 million euros, which corresponds to revenue growth of around 16 per cent in comparison to the previous year. As already announced, SinnerSchrader thus exceeds the original forecast of 35.5 million euros for the financial year.</p><p>EBITA for the year as a whole is likely to amount to around 1.5 million euros, and will hence be in the range of 1.3 million euros to 2.0 million euros, as was recently expected. This weak operative result was mainly due to spot-media’s revenue shortfall and the restructuring measures that became necessary as a result thereof. However, the reorganisation also saw Next Audience falling short of its operative earnings targets for the financial year. Considerable difficulties with a SinnerSchrader agency project in the first half of the financial year prevented the off-setting of some of these losses in earnings. By contrast, operative targets were achieved or exceeded in the media business, in business with mobile applications, and for next commerce.</p><p>Depending on assessment issues which have at present not yet been conclusively evaluated, net income is expected to be in the range of 0.1 million to 0.5 million euros.</p><p>The liquidity reserve amounted to 5.2 million euros on the balance sheet date of 31 August 2012, thus falling short of the figure for the previous year by just over 0.5 million euros, in spite of a weak result. On 31 August 2012, there were 419 employees in the SinnerSchrader Group.</p><p>The final, audited Consolidated Financial Statements for 2011/2012 will be published on 8 November 2012, together with a dividend announcement and a forecast for the 2012/2013 financial year.</p><p><strong>About SinnerSchrader<br/></strong>SinnerSchrader is one of Europe’s leading digital agencies.
