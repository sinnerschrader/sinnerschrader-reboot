title: SinnerSchrader to build future-proof mobility portal for ADAC
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><strong>Hamburg, April 2020.</strong> ADAC is entrusting SinnerSchrader to develop and run its new mobility portal <a href="https://www.adac.de/" target="_blank">adac.de</a>. The digital agency fended off a varied range of competitors in a multi-stage pitch and is now helping ADAC to create and operate a future-proof, technologically innovative platform.</p><p>In recent years, the automotive club has developed away from being a traditional breakdown assistance service and towards being a dynamic partner for all aspects of mobility with a corresponding range of services and products. The mobility portal <a href="https://www.adac.de/" target="_blank">adac.de</a> is the central port of call for millions of users for this transformation. </p><p>ADAC is operating here as a cross between a content provider and a comprehensive marketing and service platform, and uniquely combines both sides. On the one hand, publishing with a high benchmark for speed and efficient editorial, content and asset management processes and, on the other, marketing with exacting standards for relevance through member-centric services and products. </p><p>At the heart of the cooperation with SinnerSchrader is the technical overhaul of the website <a href="https://www.adac.de/" target="_blank">adac.de</a> on the basis of a customised digital experience platform. The application of API-first and cloud-native principles will make the platform scalable, low-maintenance and easy to innovate. The result is an effortless user experience and a system optimised for complex editorial demands with the fast publication of articles combined with improved page speed.</p><p>“We were looking for an agency partner with digital consulting expertise in the fields of content, data and technology in addition to direct implementation skills. A bespoke web portal that fulfils all ADAC’s needs has now been created in record time,” said Gerrit Pohl, CDO at ADAC, of the cooperation with SinnerSchrader. ADAC’s editor in chief, Martin Kunz, highlighted how important data-driven publishing is for ADAC and its more than 21 million members&#58; “The technological possibilities afforded by the new portal allow us to personalise and localise member and customer communications for the first time. The efficient use of the digital concert is enormously important to maintaining ADAC’s future viability.”</p><p>“The functional and intuitive customer experience plays an elementary role in the dialogue with <a href="https://www.adac.de/" target="_blank">adac.de</a> users. We are delighted by the trust shown in us to continue the profitable development of the offerings, and to make a key contribution towards ADAC’s internal and external digitisation,” said Dr Lars Finke (MD at SinnerSchrader) enthusiastically of the company’s new customer.</p><p>The interdisciplinary team consists of experts in the fields of development, content and editorial management, data analytics/data science and quality assurance. SinnerSchrader will serve its client from Munich, Hamburg and Frankfurt. The project will be overseen by Sanprit Singh, Stefan Schraufstetter, Martin Radicke and Lars Finke.</p><p><strong>About SinnerSchrader</strong><br/>SinnerSchrader is one of the leading digital agencies in Europe with a focus on the design and development of digital products and services.
