title: SinnerSchrader grows by 20% in Q1
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><strong>SinnerSchrader continues to grow by more than 20 per cent in the 1st quarter of 2011/2012 / Profit development on target / Goals for the 2011/2012 financial year confirm</strong></p><p>SinnerSchrader had a successful start to the 2011/2012 financial year. In the 1st quarter of 2011/2012 (1 September to 30 November 2011) the digital agency group earned net revenue of Euro 9.3 million, the first time this figure has exceeded Euro 9 million in a quarter. This means that the<br/>dynamic expansion of the business volume, started in the spring of 2010, has continued in this quarter&#58; the growth rate of 20.9 per cent in comparison to the previous year was more than 20 per cent for the sixth time in succession. In comparison to the preceding 4th quarter of 2010/2011, revenue has risen by 11.9 per cent.</p><p>SinnerSchrader continued to profit from the strong demand for services in the fields of e-commerce, digital marketing and online media. Demand appears to be unaffected by the continuing debt crisis and SinnerSchrader acquired five new clients in the Interactive Marketing segment in the period of the report, in particular from the Retail &amp; Consumer Goods sector. SinnerSchrader expects two of these new clients to generate more than Euro 1 million each.</p><p>As planned, the operating result (EBITA), at just under Euro 0.7 million, was well below the EBITA of the 1st quarter of 2010/2011, which was Euro 1.2 million. The growth-related financial pressures, comparatively high marketing costs, and the fact that an exceedingly positive 1st quarter in the previous year in the media line of business could not be repeated are the main factors in this EBITA development. Overrunning costs in an ongoing fixed-price project have also prevented the operating result from greatly surpassing the result planned for the quarter of the report.</p><p>The net income amounted to just under Euro 0.3 million or 2.3 cents per share.</p><p>Against the background of what has been achieved in the 1st quarter, SinnerSchrader is confirming the forecasts for the year as a whole&#58; increasing revenue to at least Euro 35.5 million, improving EBITA by 25 per cent to more than Euro 3.25 million, and increasing the net profit by 33 per cent to Euro 1.7 million. In view of the above-mentioned problem in a fixed-price project that has not yet been completed, tension with regard to the predicted profit has heightened markedly.</p><p>As of 30 November 2011, the business dynamics have led to far more funds being tied up in the working capital and thus to a fall in liquid funds of Euro 1.8 million, to Euro 3.9 million. The fall was so considerable because the Group's major corporate clients were slow to pay on 30 November due to their year-end planning. As of 31 December 2011, however, the liquid funds were back at Euro 4.6 million, in spite of a dividend payment of Euro 1.1 million in the interim.</p><p>The shareholders' equity rate on the balance sheet date of 30 November 2011 was unchanged in comparison to 31 August 2011, at 59.4 per cent. At the end of the quarter of this report, the SinnerSchrader Group had 419 employees, 19 more than on 31 August 2011.</p><p>The complete quarterly report can be downloaded today from 1 p.m. at <a href="www.sinnerschrader.ag/s2ir/en/5091.html">www.sinnerschrader.ag/s2ir/en/5091.html</a>.</p><p><a class="news-backlink" href="/en/"><svg class="svg-ico svg-ico--arrow-left"><use xlink&#58;href="#arrow-down"></use></svg>Back to the overview</a></p></div>
