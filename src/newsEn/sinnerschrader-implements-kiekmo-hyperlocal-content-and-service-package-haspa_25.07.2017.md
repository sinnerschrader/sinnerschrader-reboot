title: SinnerSchrader implements kiekmo hyperlocal content and service package for Haspa
content: <div class="newsbody"><p>Hamburger Sparkasse, Germany's largest savings bank, has joined forces with SinnerSchrader to launch a transformational product that makes a bank's value chain fit for the future </p><p>Hamburg, 25 July 2017 – Hamburger Sparkasse (Haspa) presents "kiekmo", a proprietary content product that sees the long-established bank branching out beyond common financial services with wide-ranging applications and free service.<br/>Comprising a multifaceted mobile app and an accompanying website for hyperlocal content as well as a groundbreaking locker system, this is an innovation with substantial added value for employees and clients alike. As part of the urban infrastructure, "kiekmo" is designed to help generate an active neighbourhood culture in Hamburg.<br/>Like city bikes and hire cars, the "kiekmo" lockers are based on the idea of a sharing economy. Objects can be temporarily stored, swapped, or handed over easily and flexibly. Around 100 lockers of different sizes are initially available in nine locations in the pilot districts of Ottensen and Eimsbüttel. <br/>SinnerSchrader developed the lockers for Hamburger Sparkasse with the leading German manufacturer LockTec, whose products include DHL Packstations. The lockers in the custom-built terminals can be activated, reserved, opened and closed via an Android and iOS application. Users can also operate the lockers without having to install the application on their smartphone, as the code can be shared from the application in various ways. </p><p>As well as controlling the lockers, the "kiekmo" app developed by SinnerSchrader provides useful facts and stories from the neighbourhood and information on events in the district every day. The "kiekmo" editors live locally and write first-hand reports. Selected district news items from media partners are also incorporated. All content is delivered accessibly in a customised content feed (mobile and desktop), and there are like, share and comment functions. A subsequent enhancement will result in a digital "blackboard" that residents can use to engage with each other even more effectively.</p><p>"kiekmo" is now available free of charge in the App Store and Google Play. </p><p>In interdisciplinary teams with Haspa, SinnerSchrader and SinnerSchraderSwipe are responsible for the strategy, conceptualisation, design, UX, content, development and implementation of app and website, social media marketing and the mechanism and use of the locker terminals.</p></div>
