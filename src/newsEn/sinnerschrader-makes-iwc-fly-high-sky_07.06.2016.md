title: SinnerSchrader makes IWC fly high in the sky
content: <div class="newsbody"><p>The traditional Swiss watch manufacturer IWC is navigating through the year 2016 under the guiding light of flying. To make the new Pilot's Watch collection a unique online brand experience, SinnerSchrader had the chance to develop an outstanding online idea - a web special, which allows the user to dream of flying. The result is a 3D web application that has been implemented for the first time worldwide&#58; the IWC Skywriter.<br/> <br/>The application reflects the skills of the legendary skywriters, who wrote their messages in breathtaking art flights. Now everyone can draw their personal message in the sky, in real time, via mobile or desktop and share it with friends. On the site, that showcases the various Pilot’s watches in the collection, there are four iconic aircraft types to choose from, which can be navigated in a 360 ° sphere through the clouds. The special feature&#58; The 3D application is built using WebGL. In this way, it works without app download in all modern browsers and on virtually every mobile device.<br/> <br/>For the implementation, SinnerSchrader found the perfect partner for interactive web applications in Artificial Rome. In collaboration with their team, Sinnerschrader developed the concept for the Skywriter. An outstanding technical feature is the seamless integration of existing video material and live rendered engine sequencies.[1] To meet the global standards of the IWC brand, both messages can be flown in Skywriter in Latin characters as well as in the main alphabet of the Asian region. This fascinating Skywriter idea is widely supported by eye-catching ads on selected channels.<br/> <br/><a href="http&#58;//skywriter.iwc.com/en">http&#58;//skywriter.iwc.com/en</a><br/> <br/><strong>About SinnerSchrader</strong><br/>SinnerSchrader is one of Europe’s leading digital agencies.
