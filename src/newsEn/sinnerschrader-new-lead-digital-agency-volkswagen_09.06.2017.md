content: <div class="newsbody"><p>Hamburg, May 2017 – Digitalisation is a key pillar of Volkswagen’s new brand strategy. It is one of the main drivers of cultural change as the automotive group strives to become a more agile organisation. As Volkswagen’s new lead digital agency, SinnerSchrader will provide Volkswagen with technical as well as content-related support which will help lead this strategic initiative. In addition, SinnerSchrader and Volkswagen have started working together in an agile, interdisciplinary partnership, since both are convinced that today’s challenges require new cross-functional ways of collaborative working that go beyond traditional client-supplier relationships.<br/> <br/>Volkswagen has selected SinnerSchrader as its partner because the digital agency embodies and employs agile methodologies and has already successfully demonstrated this with applications. Since October 2015, for example, SinnerSchrader has been developing an online configuration tool together with experts from Volkswagen as part of the company’s Next Generation Website. Now this cooperation is being extended to Volkswagen’s entire core website.<br/> <br/>“Mastering efficient and agile processes is essential for the successful development of user-oriented products,” commented Xavier Chardon, Executive Director Global Marketing &amp; Consumer. “SinnerSchrader also offers extensive experience in the areas of design, conceptualisation and strategy, coupled with a high degree of technical expertise.”<br/> <br/>“We look forward to extending this partnership and our remit for VW in order to help create an exemplary customer experience,” added Martin Gassner, Creative Managing Director at SinnerSchrader. “We applied this approach in developing the new Volkswagen online configuration tool with an innovative, responsive interface and technology design in a very short space of time.</p><img alt="S2_Press_VW_CMS_1400x788px.jpg" class="filer_image" src="/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/9d/01/9d016ad5-495d-4e35-994b-60b99f255511/s2_press_vw_cms_1400x788px.jpg__1400x788_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.jpg" srcset="/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/9d/01/9d016ad5-495d-4e35-994b-60b99f255511/s2_press_vw_cms_1400x788px.jpg__298x179_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.jpg 480w, /media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/9d/01/9d016ad5-495d-4e35-994b-60b99f255511/s2_press_vw_cms_1400x788px.jpg__1400x788_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.jpg 481w" title="„Next Generation Website“"/><span class="filer_image_info"><span class="title">„Next Generation Website“</span></span></div>
