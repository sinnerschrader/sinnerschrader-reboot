title: SinnerSchrader reports successful new customer business
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><strong>SinnerSchrader successful in business with new customers / First quarter concluded positively / Annual General Meeting votes on a 25 per cent dividend increase</strong></p><p>SinnerSchrader started the 2011/2012 financial year with wind in its sails. At the ordinary Annual General Meeting of SinnerSchrader AG held in Hamburg today, the Management Board reports on a sustained dynamic development of business. Based on preliminary figures for the first quarter of 2011/2012 (September to November 2011), revenues are expected to grow by 19 per cent over those of the previous quarter, to more than EUR 9 million. Moreover, at the end of the quarter, several significant new clients from the fashion, retail and entertainment sectors were gained and will drive business in the coming months.</p><p>"Our new business success is reinforcing the growth targets we at SinnerSchrader set for 2011/2012," says Chairman of the Management Board Matthias Schrader. "Our digital agency group thus intends to increase its net revenues by around 15 per cent to EUR 35.5 million in the 2011/2012 financial year."</p><p>The first-quarter EBITA will probably amount to EUR 0.6 million to EUR 0.7 million. Although this figure clearly falls short of results for the previous year, internal plans were easily achieved, so that the quarterly trend also emphasises the ambitious earnings forecast for the full financial year of EUR 3.25 million in EBITA (an increase of 25 per cent over that of the previous year) and EUR 1.7 million (an increase of 33 per cent over that of the previous year). Finance Director Thomas Dyckhoff&#58; "We benefit enormously from the general trend towards digital business models and perceive a strong demand for our services."</p><p>This trend had already considerably boosted business in the previous financial year. In 2010/2011 SinnerSchrader generated net revenues of EUR 30.9 million and operative earnings (EBITA) of EUR 2.6 million. This is an increase in revenues of EUR 7 million (+ 29.1 per cent) and a 19.5 per cent increase in EBITA.</p><p>With these increases, SinnerSchrader has clearly exceeded the growth targets it set itself. On this basis and in light of the positive outlook for 2011/2012, the Management Board and Supervisory Board proposed that the dividend be raised by 25 per cent over that of the previous year, to 10 cents per share, at the Annual General Meeting held today in Hamburg. This dividend will once again be paid from the contribution account for tax purposes, and is thus tax-free for those with minor holdings.</p><p><strong>About SinnerSchrader</strong><br/>SinnerSchrader is one of the leading digital agencies in Europe.
