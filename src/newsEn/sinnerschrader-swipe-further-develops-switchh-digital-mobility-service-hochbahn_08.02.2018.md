title: SinnerSchrader Swipe further develops switchh as digital mobility service for HOCHBAHN
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><strong>Hamburg, February 2018</strong> – SinnerSchrader Swipe has been awarded the contract for further development of switchh, the urban mobility platform of Hamburger Hochbahn AG (HOCHBAHN). Led by Christoph Mörl and Sven Schmiede, the company managed to win this mandate for long-term cooperation. Using SinnerSchrader’s mobile product studio, it aims to create a digital product that sets pioneering standards in terms of user experience for multi-modality.</p><p>The integrated platform is to combine all relevant, publicly available mobility services in Hamburg and will thus play an important role with regard to shared mobility. The core element of SinnerSchrader Swipe’s work will be the development of a user-centred digital service with a focus on mobile touchpoints – as native smartphone applications and a web application. The commission includes consultancy, strategy, product and service design, data analytics and software development.</p><p>Jens Brückner, head of Complementary Mobility at Hamburger Hochbahn AG, says&#58; “We see mobility as a comprehensive service. This approach requires a product that can be seamlessly integrated in people’s everyday lives and changes their awareness of sustainable mobility. Using smartphones, switchh aims to provide the easiest access to fast, affordable and environmentally friendly mobility. SinnerSchrader Swipe presented a convincing overall concept for this project, and its team impressed us with their technical expertise and strategic vision.”</p><p>Sven Schmiede, Managing Director of SinnerSchrader Swipe, comments&#58; “HOCHBAHN’s decision makes us very proud. We look forward to the interdisciplinary tasks and are aware of the responsibility involved in implementing a top-quality digital product for a service that is used hundreds of thousands of times per day.”</p><p><a class="news-backlink" href="/en/"><svg class="svg-ico svg-ico--arrow-left"><use xlink&#58;href="#arrow-down"></use></svg>Back to the overview</a></p></div>
