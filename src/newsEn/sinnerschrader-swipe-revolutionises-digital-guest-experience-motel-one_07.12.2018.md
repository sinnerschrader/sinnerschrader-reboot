SinnerSchrader Swipe is reporting another major pitch success to round off its year. In a selection process, the SinnerSchrader studio for mobile service and product development secured the contract from the Motel One hotel group for a mobile app experience.</p><p>The team led by the two managing directors Christoph Mörl and Sven Schmiede will be handling the development of a new mobile service app for the market leader in the budget hotel segment. This is intended to help consolidate Motel One’s aspiration and brand promise “Like the price. Love the design” through the digital touchpoint of a mobile application. </p><p>As part on an end-to-end approach, SinnerSchrader Swipe is taking on the strategic development and design of the digital product together with all programming responsibilities for the relevant mobile platforms.</p><p>The goal is to depict the digitisation of Motel One with a future-oriented customer experience, which begins with the hotel guests. The mobile service will combine Motel One’s beOne loyalty programme with a seamless app experience to boost direct bookings via digital channels. </p><p>In addition to a new booking function that enables bookings with a single click, the onsite experience will also be augmented and optimised by services such as mobile check-in, smart TV integration, light and sound control and mobile payment.
