title: SinnerSchrader Swipe transforms telemedicine with digital service for ADAC
content: <div class="newsbody"><h4>Media Background​</h4><p><em>The digital agency has developed a medical app for ADAC that enables permanent and location-independent medical advice via smartphone</em></p><p>Accenture Interactive daughter SinnerSchrader is co-responsible for the digital transformation of ADAC’s new products and services. The mobile studio SinnerSchrader Swipe has developed a medical app for Europe’s largest motoring association that brings it into the future-oriented area of telemedicine by providing access to mobile medical services 365 days a year. The location-independent medical advisor for the smartphone reflects changes in digital usage behaviour and meets the new travel requirements of many ADAC members, among other things.</p><p>The pandemic has also significantly accelerated the digitalisation of the healthcare sector, particularly where the availability of services is concerned. As such, innovative methods in the field of telemedicine are necessary in order to enable individual medical diagnostics that are not tied to a specific time and place. The native smartphone app from SinnerSchrader Swipe for ADAC provides travellers with an intuitive and practical user experience, allowing them to quickly and easily arrange a consultation with a doctor and contact them by video or telephone as required.To document the medical case, symptoms can be shared in the app when the appointment is made in the form of text accompanied by images or video recordings. This allows the doctor to get a comprehensive picture of the situation and give an initial assessment.The data is made available efficiently at all times via a secure connection that meets the relevant data protection regulations.</p><p>ADAC premium members and holders of ADAC foreign health insurance can now use the digital service during their overseas travel.</p><p>The app is also being realised in cooperation with the telemedicine provider Medgate Deutschland.</p></div>
