title: SinnerSchrader to take Audi into next decade
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><strong>Hamburg, April 2020.</strong> After four years as the digital lead agency, SinnerSchrader has defended its prestigious Audi contract in a multi-stage pitch. Thus, SinnerSchrader will continue to be the central international partner for the premium brand’s transformation.<br/> <br/>SinnerSchrader began its work to digitally extend Audi’s promise of “Vorsprung” in 2016. Since then, a vibrant digital ecosystem has been created for the Ingolstadt-based carmaker that enriches and simplifies its users’ lives with a number of innovative services. <br/>Sven Schuwirth, Head of Brand Audi, Digital Business and Customer Experience, has this to say about the recent decision&#58; <br/><em>“Audi moves things forward. This is the brand’s core value and Audi customers should still be able to feel that on a massive scale – today of course that mostly means digitally. That’s why we decided in favour of SinnerSchrader, the agency who can achieve this with us both conceptually and globally.”</em><br/> <br/>SinnerSchrader is able to offer the entire supply chain from a single source, from portfolio consulting to development, from design to the implementation of digital products – this gives it a fundamental edge for Michael Riedl, Audi’s Director of Digital Business Web Portals&#58; <br/><em>“The close cooperation with SinnerSchrader has brought us a great deal of success in terms of user experience. We can continue on this path only if we work together to overcome compartmentalised thinking and systematically focus on users. SinnerSchrader’s team is very persistent in this regard, which benefits all of us.” </em><br/> <br/>At SinnerSchrader, Audi operations are run by an independent studio led by Arndt Allmeling, Philipp Kafkoulas and Stefan Kroke, which combines broad technical expertise with a passion for mobility. <br/><em>“We work for Audi in a specific studio with a dedicated team of specialists. A profound knowledge of the customer and the agility of our studio model allow short development cycles with high output. It is also a model that is increasingly moving us away from just a service relationship and towards a deep-reaching partnership at all levels,”</em> said Philipp Kafkoulas, Studio Lead and Managing Director. <br/> <br/>Axel Averdung, who holds management responsibility for Audi, added&#58; <br/><em>“Audi is a shining beacon of brand-oriented technology leadership, a fact that we have to live up to every day. The digital agenda doesn’t have a pitch cycle; we are delighted to be advancing the central mobility theme of experience together with Audi. Thank you for this affirmation.”</em></p><p><strong>About SinnerSchrader</strong><br/>SinnerSchrader is one of the leading digital agencies in Europe with a focus on the design and development of digital products and services.
