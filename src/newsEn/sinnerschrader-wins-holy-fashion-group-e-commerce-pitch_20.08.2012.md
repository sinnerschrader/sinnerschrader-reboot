title: SinnerSchrader wins HOLY FASHION GROUP E-Commerce-Pitch
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><strong>Digital flagship stores for JOOP!, Strellson and windsor. to open this year<br/></strong><br/>At the beginning of the year, and after a multi-stage pitch process, SinnerSchrader managed to come out on top with a concept for high-grade, individual flagship fashion stores for the JOOP!, Strellson and windsor. brands. The rollout of the joint e-commerce platform for the JOOP!, Strellson und windsor. brands will be completed by October.</p><p>The <a href="http&#58;//shop.joop.com/">new online shop</a> will be launched already under the completely revised <a href="http&#58;//shop.joop.com/">shop.joop.com</a> website. Remaining true to the brand DNA of “Superior Extravagance,” JOOP! will continue, even digitally, to focus on visual opulence, impressive productions and extensive depictions of collections. Moving images and horizontal scrolling will convey the impression of urban window shopping, which will be complemented in the display area by direct options to buy. The entire website will have a liquid design so that customers can experience the brands and the collections even on touch-screen tablets. A contemporary shop with the German design brand is being implemented whose intuitive simplicity in terms of use will provide fashion inspiration and invite one to linger.</p><p><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-1709" height="768" src="http&#58;//www.sinnerschrader.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/joop_detail.png" width="1280"/></p><p>The technical basis for the brands’ joint e-commerce platform is hybris. SinnerSchrader created a flexible and robust infrastructure, which will also accommodate the Strellson and windsor. flagship stores in line with the brands and will be launched internationally by October. Each of the HOLY FASHION GROUP’s brands will maintain its own identity and individual brand experience. At the same time, JOOP!, Strellson and windsor. will share many commerce processes and backend solutions in future.</p><p>Reiner Pichler, CEO of the HOLY FASHION GROUP&#58;<br/>“We’re now in the position to offer our customers a high-quality fashion shopping and brand experience online. At the same time, we can take advantage of worthwhile synergies in terms of the technical platform and the joint and comprehensive organisational approach. Certain resources will be made available across brands and will offer a sound basis for the international rollout going forward.”</p><p>Matthias Schrader, CEO of SinnerSchrader&#58;<br/>“Combining individual and touch-screen-enabled brand productions with a clear, sales-oriented approach for relaxed couch shopping is a great challenge. We’re very proud to have received so much confidence from customers in terms of the concept, design, photo production and technology.”</p><p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1710" height="768" src="http&#58;//www.sinnerschrader.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/joop_look.png" width="1280"/></p></div>
