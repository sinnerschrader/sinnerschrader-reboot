title: Steinway&#58; The sound of beautiful imagery
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><a href="http&#58;//eu.steinway.com/de">eu.steinway.com/de</a></p><p>Global piano and grand piano brand Steinway &amp; Sons conveys excellence and passion with their new web presence. Their new corporate website portrays the luxury international brand with poignant imagery, capturing the exquisite sound of their pianos. Quotes from world-renowned pianists such as Lang Lang and Billy Joel express a passion for the Steinway brand. SinnerSchrader Commerce was responsible for the siteâ€™s conceptual development, design and implementation, which presents Steinway products in a playful manner. Music lovers and enthusiasts alike may explore colors and luxurious veneers from the Steinway Crown Jewels Collection, where the superb and full sound of Steinway pianos is visually commemorated. During the course of the re-launch, which was adapted for six languages (de, en, ru, es, fr, it), SinnerSchrader Commerce worked together with Steinway to revise their lead management, which is essential for this market segment due to the long buyer decision process. A rollout of the brand website in Asia is planned for 2015.</p><p><strong>Downloads&#58;</strong></p><p><a href="https://commerce-plus.com/media/filer_public/3b/8b/3b8b282f-bec3-499c-afb7-50883fb52971/screenshot_startseite_steinwayde_commerceplus.png">Screenshot Startseite Steinway</a></p><p><a href="https://commerce-plus.com/media/filer_public/65/a2/65a208a0-6606-4bbf-a35c-4509d13d0293/bildmotiv_steinway_commerceplus_smartobjekt.jpg" target="_blank">Bildmotiv Steinway</a></p><p></p><p><a class="news-backlink" href="/en/"><svg class="svg-ico svg-ico--arrow-left"><use xlink&#58;href="#arrow-down"></use></svg>Back to the overview</a></p></div>
