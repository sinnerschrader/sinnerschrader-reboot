title: Strategists are the advocate for clients and for users
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><strong>Kristina Bonitz (29) is our Director of Strategy &amp; Innovation. She has made it her personal task to make the issue of digital transformation easier. She has that much energy and love for creating something new. Kristina’s motto is “unlock collective genius”. We had a few questions …</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>First of all, what does a digital strategist do?</strong><br/><br/>The job is to facilitate innovation processes. It’s consulting and trend research at the same time. The content focus at SinnerSchrader is on digital product development. In turn, it’s about devising a company’s digital agenda or vision, breaking it down and then advising the company on how to achieve this with its organisational processes and organisational design. Strategy is an integral part of a product team, it collaborates on products and shares the responsibility for implementation and the end result. Ultimately, it’s also about being able to assess which tools and working methods you need to create digital products.<br/><br/><strong>What do you think defines a strategist?</strong><br/><br/>At a basic level, you need to be hugely curious about new topics. You also need to be able to inspire others and get deeply into issues. It’s no good only understanding things superficially. To be able to advise customers as between equals, you have to develop a deep understanding in order to penetrate users, processes and organization and thus reduce complexity.<br/><br/>Critical questioning helps, as does empathy for users, the team and customers. As strategists, we are the advocate for customers as well as for users.<br/><br/><strong>And when do you think a strategy is really good?</strong><br/><br/>For me a strategy is really good when it not only identifies a specific future scenario, but day-to-day behaviours – what needs to be done to achieve the goal. It goes all the way from the big picture to the smallest details.<br/><br/>Strategy also always has to be a decision for and against something, and it has to distinguish between the two. And if your strategy has a trinity of user requirements, business and brand goals and technological feasibility, then it’s perfect.<br/><br/><strong>How can companies do better in terms of strategy?</strong><br/><br/>A strategy never fails because of the poor quality of the idea, but rather because all stakeholders have to pull together to implement the concept and see it through to the end. German companies in particular will watch the competition to see who’s already implemented the same or a similar concept before they try something out. It’s often still wishful thinking to really be able to experiment with something within a company, and then to learn and draw some benefit from what you tried out.</p><p>Tips&#58;<br/><br/>1.     The consequences of a strategic decision should be clear to all concerned so that people do not keep on doing what they did before. As soon as a strategy has been presented and approved, a company has to be aware of the steps that come next and it has to be consistent about it.<br/><br/>2.     You should always act in the sense of the big picture and the digital ecosystem, and not just in the sense of individual tactical steps and interests.<br/><br/><strong>What do you like about our corporate culture?</strong><br/><br/>Honesty and trust are crucial. You get these values right from the top, or from studio management, and for me they are the basis of good coexistence. Trust in every direction. A team at SinnerSchrader is like a family. Each member is responsible for everyone else and not just for themselves. And to allow for individuality, it can’t be about everyone in a team being the same. You have to support the individual strengths of each individual and give them the freedom to work on areas that really interest them. This leads to innovation methods and new forms of collaboration.<br/><br/><strong>And what will be important in future?</strong><br/><br/>AI will determine much of our day-to-day lives in future. That means that creativity and humanity will become even more important. The focus is not on the user, but rather the person. Human experience is replacing user experience.<br/><br/><strong>Do you have any special sources of inspiration and energy?</strong><br/><br/>Half an hour of blog research every morning, and just paying attention to and observing what people do. More and more I find myself interested in what’s different from what I already know. The future is already happening in some people – you can see from a small group of people how we will be living.<br/><br/>Subcultures within the music and art scene inspire me. And I do a lot of sport as well, I box. And I absolutely love to cook for friends and family.</p><p></p><p><strong>Kristina Bonitz earned her a bachelor’s degree in International Management and Entrepreneurship in Hamburg and Stockholm, and has a master’s degree from Leuphana University of Lüneburg.</strong></p></div>
