title: Study on women‘s financial realities
content: <div class="newsbody"><p>Women are not the winners in the money game. On the contrary, their financial reality is still anything but fair and balanced in today's society.<br/>SinnerSchrader’s Studio Futur set out to change exactly this and to make a meaningful impact on fighting financial inequalities. In order to develop well-founded concepts and product ideas, the first step was to carry out ethnographic research. This research report gives deep insight into this topic. It is not only a must read for people working in financial services, but also for everyone interested in getting a new perspective on the underlying reasons for financial inequality.</p><p><span class="file"><a href="/media/filer_public/6c/13/6c132da1-0df4-4709-a674-5dd6c20374fa/study_on_womens_financial_realities_research_report__sinnerschrader_2021.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Study on women‘s financial realities Research Report SinnerSchrader 2021<span class="file__meta"><span class="meta__fileextension">(PDF)</span></span></a></span></p></div>
