title: There are no second chances in the digital world
content: <div class="newsbody"><p>Stefan Förster (40), copywriter and creative director, feels at home in microstructures, cultivates his love for detail, has embraced the clean desk principle and generally likes things tidy. If he weren’t employed by SinnerSchrader, he would perhaps work at a library or spend his days writing piano sonatas.</p><p><strong>How do you think people discover content? And what constitutes good content in your opinion?</strong><br/>You can compare the way people discover content roughly to the way water finds its course. And good content is always associated with added value or a real benefit. Ideally, content is also presented in a way that is optimised for its user. If this is the case, users won’t even notice that they are reading something difficult or being guided through a process, a kind of funnel, at the end of which there is a click, a subscription, a lead, a “yes” to something.</p><p><strong>Tell us about yourself and your work; what characterises it?</strong><br/>Part of my work is on the New Business Team, which is exciting because you are constantly at the beginning of an encounter. You are unaffected by and free from everything, there are no rules or regulations; you look at the new things that have come in, what someone wants or needs, what lies behind a question (or perhaps there is something entirely different behind it). This careful approach to new things is what distinguishes my job and makes it very special.<br/><br/>Another aspect of my job is to make sure that all the facets of ingenuity involved in the individual disciples work together, from design and technology to strategy or data. I make sure that our work results in products that people understand and therefore use on a daily basis. I serve as a kind of filter that makes complex matters easier to understand. For example, when the onboarding of an app is written by a skilled copywriter, not only the developers, but also a few other people will understand it and familiarise themselves with it. I just find it tempting to play dumb from time to time. It’s great fun to question what others take seriously.<br/><br/>Another factor is that the way in which a digital product speaks to you has a major impact on what you think of it, whether you like it or hate it. If you mess up the first three lines, people will hate the whole product. There are no second chances in the digital world. There is something appealing about feeling this responsibility.</p><p><strong>What motivates you in your day-to-day work?</strong><br/>For a start, it’s being surrounded by so many extremely smart people from all the various disciplines. It’s just great to get to know and work with all these extraordinary people, some of whom have very particular knowledge, and to make use of this knowledge. I also like to take off my glasses every so often and take a really close look at their work, as if I had never seen it before. It’s important to go back to the very start and look at your own work as if you were the first person on the planet.</p><p><strong>What are the job requirements for copywriters?</strong><br/>You don’t need the best marks in German; we don’t require Shakespearean writing skills here. Essentially, you should be interested in shaping digital products. It’s a job for people who want to do hands-on work in small teams, who keep producing texts, on a daily or weekly basis, and really put them out there. You should be able to understand interrelationships and want to optimise them. The writing part you can learn along the way, you don’t need to know everything right from the start. We provide training and support, no one is left alone. We guide our employees and help them acquire the skills of the trade.</p><p><strong>How do you react when you receive negative feedback on something you put a lot of effort into and polished the texts over and over again?</strong><br/>Feedback is always good, always justified and always important. And if necessary, you pick up your quill again and change everything. We’re not here for personal fulfilment, it’s about providing a perfect service. Usually the texts are written so well that they have next to no discernible writing characteristics. True mastery is to generate the right amount of attention with these few words you have that fit into the tiny space available on a smartphone or watch. To me, you have reached perfection when these few words convey the essence of a brand.</p><p><strong>How do you measure the success of your work?</strong><br/>When what we thought up and created for the people really gets through to them in the end. When we make it easier for them to do what they have to or want to do at that moment. It kind of sounds like “the best of the 2000s”, but to me, PayPal is simply a perfect digital product. It’s a nice narrow bridge to what I want to do. There is nothing in the way, everything is taken care of – the data tornado roars behind the scenes.<br/>After all, the reason we all want to use something is not because it’s cool, but because it benefits us directly. You don’t usually take notice of digital products, while physical products are visible and take up space. A car is a statement, a digital product is pure benefit. If we make this benefit accessible and give users space to act, then we have reached our goal.</p><p><strong>Stefan’s top 5 list of books</strong></p><ul><li>Silence, John Cage (inspiration)</li><li>Lolita, Vladimir Nabokov (writing style)</li><li>The Gay Science, Friedrich Nietzsche (stringent work on ideas)</li><li>The Death of Virgil, Hermann Broch (opposite of Microcopy)</li><li>Microcopy – The Complete Guide, Kinnereth Yifrah (self-improvement)</li></ul></div>
