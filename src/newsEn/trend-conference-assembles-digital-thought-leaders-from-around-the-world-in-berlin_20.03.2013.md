title: Trend conference assembles digital thought leaders from around the world in Berlin
content: <div class="newsbody"><p><strong>As of today, the NEXT13 programme is online. International innovators and industry leaders will gather at this trend conference of the digital economy on 23 &amp; 24 April. Expect Robert Scoble, Stephen Wolfram (Wolfram Alpha) and the digital chief of Obama's data-driven re-election campaign to inspire the audience at the Berliner Congress Center. View the entire programme at <a href="http&#58;//nextberlin.eu">nextberlin.eu</a></strong></p><p>The digital revolution and the interactive consumer are shaking up the foundations of our daily lifes and changing the way we run our businesses. Which innovations will shape our economy the most in the forthcoming 12 to 36 months will be explored at the annual conference NEXT Berlin. In its eighth year, NEXT Berlin will take place on 23 &amp; 24 April, for the first time at the Berliner Congress Center, right in the heart of the German capital.</p><p>Today, digital agency SinnerSchrader - the founders of NEXT Berlin - announce the extensive conference programme for 2013. Says Matthias Schrader, CEO of SinnerSchrader and NEXT Chairman&#58; "Digital innovations have - now more than ever - a radical impact on each and every sector, be it commerce, finance, media or telecommunications. NEXT Berlin looks at trends before they become mainstream, and offers the chance to address them and network with experts at a very early stage. "</p><p>The example of this year's CeBIT motto 'Shareconomy' illustrates this mechanism quite well, as it was the NEXT theme back in 2009 that applied the term to digital transformations. The theme for NEXT13 has a deliberately nebulous, almost mystic motto&#58; ‘Here be Dragons’. "The theme plays with the notion that there are no general business instructions any more," says NEXT Programme Director Peter Bihr. "It’s time to cross borders, discover unknown territories and seize new opportunities there. At NEXT13 many visionaries will give thematic overviews and practical tips on the digital trends of tomorrow that are worth exploring today."</p><p>On three stages and in numerous workshops more than 100 experts will share their knowledge with NEXT13 attendees. Around 2,000 participants are expected at the Berliner Congress Center. These will include representatives of large corporations and agencies, business developers, marketing experts, technology wizards and creatives, as well as many start-ups, for whom Deutsche Telekom incubator hub&#58;raum will provide a track, specifically dealing with their topics and pitches.</p><h3>Dome Stage</h3><p>International thought leaders will present their ideas from the stage with the characteristic dome. Among them will be Wolfram Alpha inventor Stephen Wolfram, the digital head of Obama's re-election campaign, Harper Reed, tech blogger Robert Scoble, the futurist Marina Gorbis (Institute for the Future), the grand seigneur of the start-up scene, Yossi Vardi, science fiction author Bruce Sterling and Thomas Kiessling (Chief Innovation Officer of Deutsche Telekom). In a session titled 'Dragonslayers', big players like Ulrich Hegge (comdirect bank), Stanton Sugarman (European publishing major Gruner + Jahr), Peter Rampling (Telefónica) and Matthias Schmidt-Pfitzner (Deutsche Telekom) will discuss how to tackle the digital challenges faced by their industries. Programme director Monique van Dusseldorp will be the host together with presenter, actor and speakers’ coach Ole Tillmann.</p><p>Further programme highlights will illuminate the theme ‘Here be Dragons’ from different perspectives. According to Martin Recke (Head of NEXT Berlin)&#58; "We identified four major trends for the conference’s programme&#58; There will be a session on the Maker Movement, which will show how new production opportunities are changing our society. The second session - dealing with new interfaces and human-machine interaction - will not be confined to the screen surface but will also penetrate into areas of robotics. In addition we will have a session on digital technologies becoming invisible, and will demonstrate the ever-growing importance of context with the help of expert Robert Scoble.”</p><h3>White Stage</h3><p>While the Dome Stage programme will draw the 'bigger picture', the White Stage will have a more practical focus which promises, among other things, the presentation of interesting case studies. In the Money session Barbara Karuth-Zelle (Allianz), Jörg Ziesche (ING-DiBa), Konstantin Wolff of the mobile payment service Payleven and Mikko Teerenhovi of the Finnish finance start-up Holvi will show smart banking services and payment systems of the future.</p><p>Another session will focus on service design with contributions from the top experts Birgit Mager (Service Design Network), Anne Pascual (IDEO), Louisa Heinrich (Superhuman) and Axel Averdung (SinnerSchrader). They will explain service design from scientific, strategic and practical perspectives.<br/>Representatives of the DIY marketplace Etsy (Caroline Drucker), the sharing platform for private accommodations Airbnb (Gunnar Froh) and the taxi-competitor Uber (Daniel Michalczyk) will show the disruptive forces of new players in the field of e-commerce and services. Further sessions are planned for mobile trend topics, creative applications, and new robotic technologies.</p><h3>Start-up Stage</h3><p>This year, NEXT Berlin will put an even stronger focus on Europe’s startup scene. After the success of last year’s partnership, Deutsche Telekom and its incubator hub&#58;raum will again partner the start-up track, this time on both conference days. On the first day, the programme will revolve around topics relevant to entrepreneurs. For example, there will be representatives of hub&#58;raum, Wayra and TechStars answering questions on corporate venturing. The venture capitalists Niko Wäsche (German Media Pool), Gabriel Matuschka (Partech) and Bryce Roberts (O'Reilly AlphaTech) will address funding options for start-ups, and in the session 'Building Start-ups' founders will give practical advice on product development, design and team building.</p><p>The second day will feature the start-ups that have made it into the finals of the NEXT Start-up Pitch. Until March 29 the NEXT community can vote for their favorite nominees at nextberlin.eu/startups, thus helping them to make it into the second round. A jury will then select the 12 lucky finalists from the community’s Top 30, who will be invited to present their ideas live on stage at NEXT Berlin. Hermione Way (Newspepper, TNW) will lead the programme in her matchlessly witty way, while experts like business developer Paula Martilla, hub&#58;raum founder Peter Borchers, Etsy manager Caroline Drucker and investor Rob Moffat of Balderton Capital will judge the pitches and select the hottest start-up idea. The winner will gain international attention and a prize package worth 20,000 Euros.</p><h3>Workshops</h3><p>Apart from the three main stages, more than 20 workshops will impart business relevant knowledge. Agencies such as SinnerSchrader, Interone and iCrossing will contribute to the programme, as will artist Juha van't Zelfde and the PR experts Colette Ballou and Tilo Bonow. In addition, the Berlin Geekettes and the newly formed Digital Club Franco-Allemand are planning meet-ups.</p><p><strong>About NEXT Berlin</strong><br/>NEXT Berlin has established itself in recent years as an important agenda setter for tomorrow’s topics of the digital economy in Europe.
